It's wedged between the towering peaks of the Rocky Mountains and the plunging chasm of the Rio Grande Gorge. Located about 70 miles north of Santa Fe, this is a town of 6,000 residents. There are plenty of mainstream attractions -- Taos boasts some of the best restaurants in the state, a hot and funky arts scene, and incredible outdoors action, including world-class skiing.

The history of Taos may be much different if the railroad had not bypassed the area in favor of Santa Fe in the late 1800's. Soon after many artists began to migrate to the area to paint the dramatic scenery afforded by the unparalleled terrain. As time went on more and more artists of all disciplines began to move to the area forming a culture that remains today. It is estimated that 20-25% of all residents in the area are artists (painters, sculptures, writers, or musicians). 

The city of Taos is merely the focal point of rugged 2,200-square-mile Taos County. Two features dominate this sparsely populated region: the high desert mesa, split in two by the 650-foot-deep gorge of the Rio Grande and the Sangre de Cristo range, which tops out at 13,161-foot Wheeler Peak, the highest point in New Mexico. From the forested uplands to the sage-carpeted mesa, the county is home to a large variety of wildlife.

You can build up to a 200 square foot structure with a median roof height of no more than 10' without a building permit. There are several cabins and storage structures already built in the area. We saw a freshly constructed storage/weather bunker being constructed last time we visited. 

The primary attractions in the area are fishing, camping, hunting, hiking, and any other outdoor activity you can think of. This property is situated between Deadhorse and Campbell lakes, offering wonderful fishing opportunities. Scenic vistas of the lakes and the surrounding country are found throughout this system, but particularly from the heights of Campbell and Dead Horse Rims. On a clear day the distant views from these lofty viewpoints are spectacular and limited only by the curvature of the Earth.

If you are going to be on your land for more than 30 days, however, make sure you know that the health department will want you to have a septic system. This and most of the land in the county is zoned as agricultural which gives you lots of options.

Many lots in Apache county do not have utilities. Some people find that solar is a good option. Water is often hauled in or delivered. Property taxes are low, although part of that is because the county only maintains certain roads. There are other roads, called N roads that are not maintained. Some of them are better than others. You may need an all-wheel drive vehicle to get to some places and it may also depend on the weather.

One nearby attraction is the beautiful Petrified Forest National Park. There are also several National Forests that are not too far away: Apache-Sitgraves, Coconino, Prescott, Kaibab, and Gila National Forests. 

This particular property is a 1 acre piece of land not far from Sanders. You can get there by leaving the frontage road along Interstate 40 and offroading about a mile. Right next to state-owned land.

Someone with more time may find more. Gold prices were over $1900/ounce. Though we could never guarantee what you will find, we did locate this claim in an historically rich area for gold and prospecting.
Gold has gone up $400 in 3 years.
We also found some nice smoky quartz and fluorite on the claim.

This is not a sharing with others of your 20 acre claim.

We live in Ohio. Our connection to Colorado is our daughter lives in Denver, though she is not involved with our claims. We visited her in September, then went to prospect and locate mining claims, as we have been doing for a number of years.

And just a note of encouragement for you if purchase:
My wife and I have located, prospected on, and sold mining claims in
California, Colorado, Arizona, and now also in Montana, Wyoming, and South Dakota, going on now for over 25 years.
You can trust we will process your notarized deeds correctly and quickly.
In that mining claims are processed thru the Bureau of Land Management, a
Federal Govt. agency, not following thru per our legally signed contract, would be a federal crime. I certainly will do what I say, and would never put myself nor my wife in any legal jeopardy.
Also, we have sold properties on 5 sites online for over 25 years:
Landsalelistings, Landwatch, LandandFarm, and LandsofAmerica.
Our continued good status on these sites is due to our always following thru, as just one time we would not, we would not be allowed to sell on these sites ever again.

With elevations ranging from 4000-10631 feet the air is clean and the views are spectacular. Mild temperatures, along with the surrounding mountains and the Humboldt River, make Eureka County an outdoor playground. The outdoor enthusiast will never lack for activity. Hunting, fishing, hiking, swimming and much more are all readily available.

Rio Rancho, NM is...This property is just waiting for your creativity and passion to get used to its full potential! Rio Rancho, NM is a highly demanded area because it offers the closeness to Albuquerque but also allows you to actually buy land and build houses for an affordable price compared to Albuquerque. Albuquerque has seen a huge increase in demand for its land and more and more homes are getting built every single day. Its an area currently in the upswing, so make sure you lock your new real estate development before prices go higher and higher and things are getting more expensive. Albuquerque's attractions are clustered around the downtown area, and this is the best place to stay, especially for first-time visitors wanting a true Southwest experience. This is where you'll find Old Town, with its quaint cobblestone streets, old Southwest architecture, unique restaurants and shops, and towering cottonwood trees overhead. 
According to the Rio Rancho Estates Area Plan, The area of south central Sandoval County, now known as Rio Rancho Estates, is made up of a portion of the Town of Alameda Land Grant, dating from Spanish settlement in the 1700s, as well as a portion of the King Ranch. During the years from 1960 to 1975, the American Realty and Petroleum Corporation (AMREP) purchased 90,000 acres of this land and subdivided it into thousands of lots, mostly one-half and one acre parcels. Through an extensive advertising campaign, many of these properties were sold to individuals from all over the world. Rio Rancho emerged in this process as an urban area, and in 1981, incorporated. Through successive annexations, Rio Rancho became one of the fastest growing cities in the United States and now holds more than 85,000 residents, including just over half of the original AMREP land holdings. The remaining unincorporated area of roughly 60 square miles, and 43,629 acres.

Because of the altitude (4335 feet above sea level), summers are characterized by moderately warm days. Maximums are mostly in the 90s, rarely rising to 100 degrees or higher. Nights are comfortably cool. Maximum temperatures usually occur during June, while in July and August frequent afternoon thunderstorms tend to hold down daytime temperatures. Winters are noted for their clear skies and sunny weather. Daytime temperatures, even during the coldest months, average well into the 50s. As may be expected in arid climates, humidity year round is low, sometimes as low as 5%.

La Playa Estates is located in the town of Cochise and a few miles southwest of Willcox, Arizona. Unlike many areas in Cochise County, there is development in this subdivision. The lot measures a total of 1.13 Acres, is buildable, and NOT in a flood zone. This is a great area to either build or simply start your land portfolio at an affordable price.  

City of Willcox
The air is unpolluted, the water is pure, the temperatures are moderate, and the sunsets are spectacular. Willcox has plenty of things to keep everyone busy from outdoor recreation such as hiking, biking, camping; bird watching to beautiful sunsets. Historic downtown Willcox is home to some of Willcox Wine Country tasting rooms, interesting shops, restaurants, museums, and great people.

Originally known as ""Maley"", the town was founded in 1880 as a wh...Originally known as ""Maley"", the town was founded in 1880 as a whistlestop on the Southern Pacific Railroad. It was renamed in honor of a visit by General Orlando B. Willcox in 1889. The town was incorporated in 1915. In the early 20th century, Willcox had the distinction of being a national leader in cattle production. Agriculture remains important to the local economy, and Willcox has maintained its rural lifestyle through a strong agricultural and ranching economy.

Cochise County
Home to Tombstone, Cochise County has over 130,000 residents. Area industries include copper, cattle, cotton and silver. In the county's largest city, Sierra Vista, US Army Intelligence Center Fort Huachuca helps to contribute to an already strong economy. While the county may be large in size (as large as Connecticut and Rhode Island combined), you will find more similarities than differences as you traverse the area.

Interstate 80 traverses Elko County, making it a convenient destination. With a population of around 25,000, the city has all the amenities one could need including restaurants, hotels, and shopping. This area of Nevada also has many outdoor activities within a short drive. The mountains, lakes, and rivers around Elko offer numerous recreational opportunities. Among the wide-open spaces can be found spectacular mountain ranges and canyons suitable for picnicking, hiking or more serious outdoor adventures.  Elko County is the fourth largest county in the United States, consisting of 17,181 square miles, as big as five of the New England states plus the District of Columbia.

With two spectacular wilderness areas and thousands of square miles of open space, Elko County offers limitless outdoor recreation opportunities  including hiking, mountain biking, rock climbing, horseback riding, camping, golf, wildlife viewing, backpacking, boating, fishing and ATVing. The Ruby Mountains, which have been described as Nevadas Alps, provide the most breathtaking scenery. Hiking trails are suitable for all skill levels, from the family-friendly Nature Trail to the 40-mile Ruby Crest Trail. Trails for hikers and horseback riders lead over Liberty Pass into the Ruby Wilderness, with its clear alpine lakes and panoramic views.

Three-quarters of Elko County is public land, which gives wildlife such as mule deer, antelope, mountain goats and bighorn sheep plenty of room to roam. The hunting season offers tag-holders a shot at big game, as well as the unusual birds such as chukar and Hungarian partridge, Sagehen, Quail, Dove and the illusive Himalayan Snowcock.

This is a 20.66 acre unpatented, gold and gem LODE mining claim, the Willow Creek Lode #2 claim, and is southeast of the town of Rand.  
This area is a ranching community, with working ranches, and has the look and the feel of the old West. Our claim here is 10 miles SE of the town of Rand, in Jackson County, Colorado.

Besides the vein of a valuable mineral running thru the claim, the claim also has a branch of Willow Creek running thru it where you can work the vein on the ridge, and also pan for gold in the creek. You can also prospect on the whole claim, including the claim ridges for gems outside the lode mineral vein.
A lode claim has the most potential for finding valuable minerals.

A lode claim differs from our placer claims, as on a lode claim you can dig into the mountain side and can even go t...A lode claim differs from our placer claims, as on a lode claim you can dig into the mountain side and can even go to the extent of building a mine shaft.
Having a lode claim is an advantage as you can dig into the claim with a shaft if you choose,
and with the creek also on the claim, you can also prospect in the creek for gold, increasing your prospecting potential.

See further down the listing the buying process and the 8 month financing offered.

See with the pictures maps and satellite views.
Click on the top listing picture then arrow right to see all.

Our lode claim has veins of valuable minerals including gold in veins (called lodes) cutting thru rocks. 
Quartz and gold are frequently found together and digging into the quartz vein is called chasing the vein.
Veins of quartz, smoky quartz, and fluorite are on the claim.

There are iarge, open areas for camping on the claim. including a side road for more privacy.
Willow Creek has good trout fishing,
Beautifully forested area of pines and aspens, in a valley surrounded by the Rocky Mountains.
The bends in the creek bed make for excellent gold catching areas.
Up the claim ridges are good places for gems, as is the lode mineral vein running thru the whole claim.
Area known as the moose viewing capitol of Colorado.

National Forests remained open at all times during the virus with a televised invitation by the Director for families to visit them as safe places for family recreation, making our mining claims some of the safest places for your family to enjoy and get away from all the nonsense.

Rockhounding in Colorado 
Starting with the rich gold and silver deposits which were the starting point of so many Colorado towns, the Centennial State, with over 770 types of minerals to be found, is second only to California in the number of different gems and minerals statewide.
Colorado is also host to a dizzying array of rocks and minerals. Some of the higher profile include dinosaur fossils.
Colorado can certainly be considered a rockhound and gem hunters dream. 
The vast mountains of national forests gives one a newfound sense of exploration and discovery.

Jackson County has miles and miles of snowmobile trails to add to your mining claim experience.
See the Snowmobile Trail Map further down the listing pictures.

To purchase our claim, the process would be, I would need your name(s) and addresswhere I would scan and email you a signed contract, and which payment option you choose:

Total price of $3500, that can be paid in one full payment where your ownership is then transferred after receiving payment, 
or $3500, paying $1750 first month, and $1750 2nd month,
or $3500, paying $1500 first month, $1000 2nd month, and $1000 3rd month,
or, $3500, paying $700 per month for 5 months,
or $4000, paying $500 per month for 8 months.
A $99 deed processing fee is paid with final payment.

Owner financing, No credit check. No interest charged.
No down payment
You can use the claim as yours while making monthly payments.
Ownership transfer after final monthly payment.
A signed contract will precede payment.  

Gold prices reached an all time high of $2000 per ounce:

Besides gold, this area is also known for having precious and semi-precious gemstones, including the state named gemstone aquamarine, and gems such as turquoise, crystals, opals, topaz, amethyst, and smoky quartz.

I am a retired teacher, and got into prospecting as a hobby with my family.
I am 71 and my wife 68, and we have gained the experience to select the best areas to locate claims.

We feel we are selling more than the gold and minerals on beautiful land.
You would be acquiring an experience that will give you a good feel for what the old time prospectors must have felt during the days of the original Colorado Gold Rush.

A mining claim is an affordable way to enjoy the beauty of the land combined with the adventure of panning for gold.

If within one year you are not satisfied with your claim, you can trade for another comparable claim, just paying the BLM and County transfer fees which will be about $125.

You will also receive a free Prospecting Kit once you have paid for your claim that includes,
a Rockhounding Geology Hammer Tool, Rock Pick Axe, 3 PCS Digging Chisels Kit, with Musette Bag, and a Compass. See picture of that kit with the listing pictures.
Mining Claims as an investment: if you purchase a claim from us, at no charge, I would help you if you ever decided to sell in the future.
Mining Claims are a great investment, as claims go up in value over time, just as land does.

Owning a mining claim is having access to a lifetime of great family fun and recreation, in a very beautiful, natural setting.
This county is known as the Moose Viewing Capital of Colorado, and we had a moose sighting while we were there.

This is a 20.66 acre unpatented, gold and gem mining lode claim.
The claim is legally registered with the Bureau of Land Management out of Lakewood, CO and Jackson County. You own the mineral rights, not sharing with others, on the 20.66 acres, and use your 20.66 acres recreationally for camping and prospecting in an awesome, beautiful area.
Great secluded valley, with flatter claim areas for camping. 
Not too far from the Rocky Mountain National Park, an hour from the Wyoming border.

For the possibility of constructing any building you for others could live in, you need to file a Plan of Operation with the BLM for approval, showing you have developed a full-time operation performing diligent mining, though the BLM is reluctant to approve anything to live in.
You do not need a plan, permission nor a permit to camp and prospect.
You do not need to be a full time prospector to file a Plan for a shed type structure.

With an approved BLM Plan of Operation, a building can be built on the land: any building that benefits and improves the claim, though you cannot live on a mining claim. 
As stated by the BLM, this can be the ""construction of a building, road, fence, or enclosure necessary for mining.""
Current usage, is what the BLM calls, Casual Use: panning, shovel, rock hammer, metal detector, creek powered sluice box, where no permission nor permit is needed to camp and prospect.

On our visits to the claim, we discovered a vein of quartz that also has smoky quartz and fluorite. 
We also found in the creek bed about 1/8 ounce of gold worth about $220.
We found the same amount of gold in the lode vein, on just a small part of the vein.
As the BLM does not specify the amount of gold and gems to be found to locate a claim other than a valuable mineral needs to be discovered, we use this amount for a lode claim as a projection of good gold and gem potential. Someone with more time may find more. 
Gold prices are over $1900/ounce and gems are a big business in Colorado.
Though we could never guarantee what you will find, we did locate this claim in an historically rich area for gold and gem prospecting.
Gold in the past 3 years has gone up over $400 per ounce.

You are allowed to post No Trespassing for Prospecting signs in and around the claim.
A mining claim owner may limit or restrict public recreational use of/or public access across claims or portions of claims that are actively used for prospecting, mining, or processing operations where public recreational use of a claim would endanger or materially interfere with legitimate mining pursuits.

Camp on your claim or nearby national forest campgrounds.
A claim owner does not need permission nor a permit to camp and prospect.
You can prospect as little or as much as you like.
Now that we have located the claims, you never have to declare to the BLM any gold or gems you find.

Welcome to North Park - Jackson County, Colorado!
Raw, remote, tucked deep in Colorados rugged Rockies, the high valley of North Park and its County of Jackson literally scream frontier and a past fast-held in present days. Holding true to rough and rugged times when native hunters, trappers, prospectors, and early ranchers survived off its lands and forged its history, North Park is the real West, where travelers can embrace what once was, while happily escaping what now is.
With over a million acres covering more than 1600 square miles; 65% public land; lakes, rivers and reservoirs that attract and support unique and abundant wildlife; and access to five of Colorados most rugged and pristine wilderness areas  North Park lies at the center of a minimally used and amazingly untapped recreation universe.
Light on links to the world-wide web, with mall shopping, bright lights and traffic jams at least 65 paved-miles away, it is removed from civilization, but easily accessed by civilized folk in search of solitude. Raw, Rough, Real  make your getaway to North Park this year. Unplug to plug in  disconnect from your life and reconnect with your soul.
As heavy mist rises from the lush, valley floor of Colorados North Park, a flaming Western sun gently layers the 360 horizon with pinks, reds, purples, and shimmering golds. As a large bull moose appears, disappears, and reappears along one of many river paths, a playful otter splashes ducks intent on finding breakfast in a nearby beaver pond.
And, as passing moments become priceless memories, the raw nature of North Park and Jackson County awakens the frontiersman in us all and leaves us wanting more.
North Park is truly a land of wonders, where your mind can rest, while your spirit soars.

An unpatented mining claim is a specific parcel of federal land, valuable for a specific mineral deposit or deposits. It is a parcel for which an individual has asserted a legal right of possession and the right to develop and extract a discovered, valuable, mineral deposit. 
Mining claims are real property that you can buy, sell, or inherit. After proving the existence of valuable minerals on the land, the claim is legally recorded with the Bureau of Land Management and Jackson County.

_________________________ 

Gold occurs in gravels in the metallic state and when so found has various physical characteristics. Gold is dense and heavy, it has a characteristic metallic color, and it is soft and easily malleable (it is easily formed by hammering). These are the characteristics used by prospectors to identify gold in the field.
Lode gold occurs on the claim usually in quartz veins derived from gossan formed by weathering, and oxidation of the gold, copper and iron rich veins. Gold is derived from the erosion of mineralized fault zones on the claim. 
Lode gold occurs in long running veins to be accessed thru digging with rock hammer and shovel.

TERMS
To purchase our claim, the process would be, I would need your name(s) and addresswhere I would scan and email you a signed contract, and which payment option you choose:

Total price of $3500, that can be paid in one full payment where your ownership is then transferred after receiving payment, 
or $3500, paying $1750 first month, and $1750 2nd month,
or $3500, paying $1500 first month, $1000 2nd month, and $1000 3rd month,
or, $3500, paying $700 per month for 5 months,
or $4000, paying $500 per month for 8 months.
A $99 deed processing fee is paid with final payment.

Owner financing, No credit check. No interest charged.
No down payment.
You can use the claim as yours while making monthly payments.
Ownership transfer after final monthly payment.
A signed contract will precede payment.   

After receiving your final payment, your ownership of the 20.66 acre claim will be legally recorded with the local Bureau of Land Management and Jackson County. The quit claim deed is the correct document to be recorded for a mining claim, as stated by the BLM. 
This is not a sharing with others of your 20.66 acre claim.

We live in Ohio. Our connection to Colorado is our daughter lives in Denver, though she is not involved with our claims. We visited her in September, then went to prospect and locate mining claims, as we have been doing for a number of years.

And just a note of encouragement for you if purchase:
My wife and I have located, prospected on, and sold mining claims in 
California, Colorado, Arizona, and now also in Montana, Wyoming, and South Dakota, going on now for over 25 years.
You can trust we will process your notarized deeds correctly and quickly.
In that mining claims are processed thru the Bureau of Land Management, a Federal Govt. agency, not following thru per our legally signed contract, would be a federal crime. I certainly will do what I say, and would never put myself nor my wife in any legal jeopardy.
Also, we have sold properties on 4 sites online for over 25 years:
Landsalelistings, Landwatch, LandsofAmerica, and LandandFarm.
Our continued good status on these sites is due to our always following thru, as just one time we would not, we would not be allowed to sell on these sites ever again.

COMMENTS FROM SATISFIED CLAIM BUYERS:

You are awesome!!! I cannot thank you enough.
I seriously cant say thanks enough for making this process so seamless. I look forward to visiting the claim in the coming weeks!  If more claims pop up around this Colorado location, I have a buddy who is interested as well.

""We visited and panned on our claim creek in Colorado this past June and had a wonderful time. Were very pleased with the location and the claim itself.""
 
""We have been to our mining claim in California that we purchased from you last year. The area is stunningly beautiful, and we couldn't be happier with our purchase.""

""Living in Arizona, the mining claim we purchased from you has added greatly to our family outings. We are finding gold in the wash on our claim most every visit. 
Thank you so much!""",3500,20.66,N/A,".., ",200,"https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4101864844,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4101864846,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4101864858,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4101864842,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4101864841,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4101864936,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4101864871,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4101864870,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4101864886,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4101864887,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4101864890,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4101864893,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4101864897,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4101864913,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4101864919,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4101864924,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4101864927,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4101864928,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4101864929,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4101864930"

The best-kept secret in north Arkansas is Horseshoe Bend. Nestled in the Ozark Mountains on the Strawberry River, this quaint town is the perfect place to find rest, relaxation, and recreation.

On Crown Lake, water lovers can participate in a variety of activities, including swimming, kayaking, paddle boarding, water skiing, and tubing. Crown Lake is best known for good fishing, but it is not the only sought-after fishing hole in the area. Besides Crown Lake and the Strawberry River, fishing enthusiasts can also visit one of the smaller fishing lakes  Diamond, Pioneer, and North.
 
There are plenty of activities for young and old alike! Golfers have their choice between two par 3, 18-hole golf courses. Citizens and guests can also bowl, pitch horseshoes, and play miniature golf. The town has several stores, a library, three resorts, a community theater, a spa, and several restaurants.
 
The citizens of Horseshoe Bend take pride in the community spirit and the ability to offer a memorable experience for all who come to visit. The Music in the Mountains show occurs every third Saturday of the month, and during summer, the Farmers Market occurs every Wednesday. Every year, the town celebrates Dogwood Days on the second Saturday of May, and Independence Day is celebrated every 4th of July with a parade and fireworks. The annual Christmas parade occurs on the first Saturday in December. There are many more events that happen throughout the year, thanks to the numerous civic groups which are active in Horseshoe Bend. All of these events embrace the unique Ozark culture of small-town pride and fellowship.
 
The largest town in Izard County with 2,180 residents, Horseshoe Bend is accessible to the state's most scenic highways. The town is centrally located and just a 3-hour drive to Little Rock, Memphis, and Springfield. With its gorgeous views, slower pace of life, and laid-back charm, Horseshoe Bend is the perfect place to stay a week or a lifetime.

This area of Nevada also has many outdoor activities within a short drive. The mountains, lakes, and rivers around Elko offer numerous recreational opportunities. Among the wide-open spaces can be found spectacular mountain ranges and canyons suitable for picnicking, hiking or more serious outdoor adventures.  Elko County is the fourth largest county in the United States, consisting of 17,181 square miles, as big as five of the New England states plus the District of Columbia.

With two spectacular wilderness areas and thousands of square miles of open space, Elko County offers limitless outdoor recreation opportunities  including hiking, mountain biking, rock climbing, horseback riding, camping, golf, wildlife viewing, backpacking, boating, fishing and ATVing. The Ruby Mountains, which have been described as Nevadas Alps, provide the most breathtaking scenery. Hiking trails are suitable for all skill levels, from the family-friendly Nature Trail to the 40-mile Ruby Crest Trail. Trails for hikers and horseback riders lead over Liberty Pass into the Ruby Wilderness, with its clear alpine lakes and panoramic views.

Three-quarters of Elko County is public land, which gives wildlife such as mule deer, antelope, mountain goats and bighorn sheep plenty of room to roam. The hunting season offers tag-holders a shot at big game, as well as the unusual birds such as chukar and Hungarian partridge, Sagehen, Quail, Dove and the illusive Himalayan Snowcock.

The claim is on a side road off of the main road adding to its privacy, with several open camping areas, including one by the creek.

An open camping area is on the claim where you can camp near the year round flowing Beaver Creek.
There are some nice bends in the creek making for good gold catching areas.
Also a good area for gem prospecting up the mountain ridges.
Located i...Located in a beautiful forest of pines and aspens.
Grand County has a number of beautiful lakes, see listing pictures.

The claim is just 15 miles to beautiful Williams Fork Reservoir, 28 miles to Lake Granby, 42 miles to Winter Park Ski Resort, and about 45 miles to Rocky Mountain National Park.Beaver Creek is a tributary of the Colorado River that flows thru the nearby town of Hot Sulphur Springs.The claim is located near two state wildlife areas, with great opportunities for wildlife viewing.
National Forests remained open at all times during the virus with a televised invitation by the Director for families to visit them as safe places for family recreation, making our mining claims some of the safest places for your family to enjoy and get away from all the nonsense.

Rockhounding in Colorado 
Starting with the rich gold and silver deposits which were the starting point of so many Colorado towns, the Centennial State, with over 770 types of minerals to be found, is second only to California in the number of different gems and minerals statewide.
Colorado is also host to a dizzying array of rocks and minerals. Some of the higher profile include dinosaur fossils.
Colorado can certainly be considered a rockhound and gem hunters dream. 
The vast mountains of national forests gives one a newfound sense of exploration and discovery.

A mining claim is an affordable way to enjoy the beauty of the land combined with the adventure of panning for gold and using your rock hammer for gens up the mountain ridges on the claim.
Owning a mining claim is having access to a lifetime of great family fun and recreation, in a very beautiful, natural setting.

We feel we are selling more than the gold and gems on beautiful land.
You would be acquiring an experience that will give you a good feel for what the old time prospectors must have felt during the days of the original Colorado Gold Rush.

Besides gold, this area is also known for having precious and semi-precious gemstones, including the state named gemstone aquamarine, and gems such as fluorite, turquoise, crystals, opals, topaz, amethyst, and smoky quartz.

About an hour northeast is the Grand Lake area known as the snowmobiling capital of Colorado, and our claims here all have such access during the Winter.
See the Snowmobile Trail Map further down the listing pictures.

Another good sign for our claims here are the other experienced prospectors who have claims throughout Grand County as most of the county is now all claimed up.

To purchase our claim, the process would be, I would need your name(s) and addresswhere I would scan and email you a signed contract, and which payment option you choose:

Total price of $3500, that can be paid in one full payment where your ownership is then transferred after receiving payment, 
or $3500, paying $1750 first month, and $1750 2nd month,
or $3500, paying $1500 first month, $1000 2nd month, and $1000 3rd month,
or, $3500, paying $700 per month for 5 months,
A $99 deed processing fee is paid with final payment.

Owner financing, No credit check. No interest charged.
No down payment.
You can use the claim as yours while making monthly payments.
Ownership transfer after final monthly payment.
A signed contract will precede payment.   

Gold prices reached an all time high of $2000 per ounce:

I am a retired teacher, and got into prospecting as a hobby with my family.
I am 72 and my wife 69, and we have gained the experience to select the best areas to locate claims.

This is an ideal place to own a mining claim, being only 10 miles from the mountain town of Hot Sulphur Springs. 
Though you are out in the wilderness, all the necessities are close by.
Outdoor activity does not stop here in the Winter.
Grand County is known as the snowmobiling capital of Colorado.

For the possibility of constructing any building you or others could live in, you need to file a Plan of Operation with the BLM for approval, showing you have developed a full-time operation performing diligent mining, though the BLM is reluctant to approve anything to live in.
You do not need a plan, permission nor a permit to camp and prospect.
You do not need to be a full time prospector to file a Plan for a shed type structure.

If within one year you are not satisfied with your claim, you can trade for another comparable claim, just paying the BLM and County transfer fees which will be about $125.

Claim buyer will also receive a new, free, Gold Panning Kit:
One 14 inch Gold Trap pan; One 10.5 inch Gravity Trap pan, One combination sifter/classifier with 7/16 of an inch exit holes, One Gold Guzzler snuffer bottle, One Tweezers/ Magnifying Glass combo tool.

Locals are aware of the gold panning potential in the creeks in this area, and the whole county area has a number of prospectors owning and working their claims for years.

With an approved BLM Plan of Operation, a building can be built on the land: any building that benefits and improves the claim, though you cannot live on a mining claim. 
As stated by the BLM, this can be the ""construction of a building, road, fence, or enclosure necessary for mining.""
Current usage, is what the BLM calls, Casual Use: panning, shovel, rock hammer, metal detector, creek powered sluice box, where no permission nor permit is needed to camp and prospect.

According to geologists, placer gold deposits are present in nearly every creek in this Rocky Mountain area. 
This area in particular is surrounded by gold-bearing creeks, including Beaver Creek. 
The area once prospected by early settlers, the area creeks are still considered to contain placer gold.

Mining Claims as an investment: if you purchase a claim from us, at no charge, I would help you if you ever decided to sell in the future.
Mining Claims are a great investment, as claims go up in value over time, just as land does.
This is also an area where you can explore and prospect for gems off the creek on your claim.

This is a 20 acre unpatented, gold mining placer claim, the Grand County Gold #6 with beautiful Beaver Creek running thru the claim, and is in Grand County, Colorado, in the beautiful Rocky Mountains and the Arapaho National Forest. The claim is legally registered with the Bureau of Land Management out of Lakewood, CO and the Grand County Recorder. 
You own the mineral rights, not sharing with others, on the 20 acres, and use your 20 acres recreationally for camping and prospecting in an awesome, beautiful area.

20 acres = 660 ft. x 1320 ft.

Camp on your claim or in the areas national forest campgrounds.
A claim owner does not need permission nor a permit to camp and prospect.
You can prospect as little or as much as you like.
Now that we have located the claim, you never have to declare to the BLM any gold or gems you find.

On our visits to the claim, we gathered in and around the creek, approx. 1/8 of an ounce of gold, being worth about $225. As the BLM does not specify the amount of gold to be found to locate a claim other than gold needs to be discovered, we use this amount for a 20 acre claim as a projection of good gold potential.

Grand County is brimming with natural beauty, adventure, and authentic Colorado heritage. Each town has its own distinct character and story to tell. Home to Colorados largest natural lake, Grand Lake, and the headwaters of the Colorado River, Grand County offers the most accessible water for recreation in Colorado. Only 67 miles from Denver, Grand County is the ultimate getaway for a genuine Colorado experience.
Search for riches continues in Grand County where Gold Rush miners left off. In 1875 silver, lead, copper, and gold ore were discovered in the Never Summer Range, less than 20 miles from the shores of Grand Lake. A mining boom soon echoed across the region, creating such towns as Gaskill, Dutchtown, Teller City, and Lulu City. Mines like the Ruby, Eureka, Bonanza, and the Wolverine brought eager miners from Georgetown, Denver, and points east.

People in Grand County have mastered the art of relaxation. It would only seem natural, given the spectacular surroundings and the away-from-it-all tranquility of the valleys.
Known for its outdoor activities means Grand County offers ways of restoring sore muscles with the right dose of hot springs soaking, spa treatment, and even a few sips of local vino.
So if you find yourself in need of a break from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, come on up to Grand County.

_________________________

The creek on the claim is a unique advantage for gold prospecting.
Gold always occurs in gravels in the metallic state and when so found has various physical characteristics. Gold is dense and heavy, it has a characteristic metallic color, and it is soft and easily malleable (it is easily formed by hammering). These are the characteristics used by prospectors to identify gold in the field.
Placer gold occurs on the claim as small grains derived from gossan formed by weathering, and oxidation of the gold, copper and iron rich veins. Gold also occurs as grains flakes and small nuggets derived from the erosion of mineralized fault zones on, and upstream from the claim.

TERMS:
To purchase our claim, the process would be, I would need your name(s) and addresswhere I would scan and email you a signed contract, and which payment option you choose:

Total price of $3500, that can be paid in one full payment where your ownership is then transferred after receiving payment, 
or $3500, paying $1750 first month, and $1750 2nd month,
or $3500, paying $1500 first month, $1000 2nd month, and $1000 3rd month,

A $99 deed processing fee is paid with final payment.

Owner financing, No credit check. No interest charged.
No down payment.
You can use the claim as yours while making monthly payments.
Ownership transfer after final monthly payment.
A signed contract will precede payment.    

After receiving your final payment, your ownership of the 20 acre claim will be legally recorded with the local Bureau of Land Management and Grand County. The quit claim deed is the correct document to be recorded for a mining claim, as stated by the BLM. 
This is not a sharing with others of your 20 acre claim.

We live in Ohio. Our connection to Colorado is our daughter lives in Denver, though she is not involved with our claims. We visited her in September, then went to prospect and locate mining claims, as we have been doing for a number of years.

And just a note of encouragement for you if purchase:
My wife and I have located, prospected on, and sold mining claims in
California, Colorado, Arizona, and now also in Montana, Wyoming, and South Dakota, going on now for over 25 years.
You can trust we will process your notarized deeds correctly and quickly.
In that mining claims are processed thru the Bureau of Land Management, a
Federal Govt. agency, not following thru per our legally signed contract, would be a federal crime. I certainly will do what I say, and would never put myself nor my wife in any legal jeopardy.
Also, we have sold properties on 5 sites online for over 25 years:
Landsalelistings, Landwatch, LandandFarm, and LandsofAmerica.
Our continued good status on these sites is due to our always following thru, as just one time we would not, we would not be allowed to sell on these sites ever again.

You are awesome!!! I cannot thank you enough.
I seriously cant say thanks enough for making this process so seamless. I look forward to visiting the claim in the coming weeks!  If more claims pop up around this Colorado location, I have a buddy who is interested as well.

""Living in Colorado, the purchase of our mining claim from you has been great for family fun and recreation. We have camped overnight a number of times, and panned for gold in the creek. We were even able to find gold flakes on several of our attempts. Thank you so much!.""

""We purchased a 40 acre claim in California from Mr. Leu. Our claim is everything he told us it would be: Beautiful area, great for family camping outings, and, we have found gold while panning in the creek on our claim. We could not be happier with our purchase!""

""We purchased 2 mining claims from Michael Leu over the last 2 years, one in California, and one In Colorado. We have been to our claims on several occasions, and we could not be happier! They are exactly as described, and our camping on our claims and prospecting in the creek on each claim is the highlight of our vacations. You can trust Mr. Leu. If you are looking for a great time in the awesome beauty of the west, buying a mining claim from Mr. Leu will be a blessing.""",3500,20,N/A,"., 133",200,"https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673854,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673856,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673855,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673857,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673947,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673859,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673858,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673860,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673945,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673863,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673864,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673861,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673897,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673902,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673911,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4105983168,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673914,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673915,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673916,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673913,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673917,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673918,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673923,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673925,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673928,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673932,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673937,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673938,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673939,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673940,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673941,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673942,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673943,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673944,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099673948"

This is a legally registered unpatented 20.66 acre gold and gem LODE mining claim for sale, the Superstition Lode #4.
The mineral vein runs West to East thru the middle of the claim.

National Forests remained open at all times during the virus with a televised invitation by the Director for families to visit them as safe places for family recreation, making our mining claims some of the safest places for your family to enjoy and get away from all the nonsense

This is now our last lode mining claim in this area as the one other one we had here was sold.

Besides the quartz/gold vein running thru the claim, long washes run North and South and also East and West on the claim to increase your gold prospecting potential.
Up the buttes on the claim are good places for gems.
There are open camping areas between the road and ...There are open camping areas between the road and the wash on the claim.

See further down the listing the buying process and the 8 month financing offered.

See with the pictures maps and satellite views.
Click on the top listing picture then arrow right to see all.

A lode claim differs from our placer claims, as on a lode claim you can dig into the mountain side and can even go to the extent of building a mine shaft.
Having a lode claim is an advantage as you can dig into the claim with a shaft if you choose,
and with the creek also on the claim, you can also prospect in the creek for gold, increasing your prospecting potential.

Our lode claim has veins of valuable minerals including gold in veins (called lodes) cutting thru rocks. Quartz and gold are frequently found together and digging into the quartz vein is called chasing the vein.
Veins of quartz, smoky quartz, and fluorite are on the claim.

Located in Hackberry Canyon about 13.2 miles NE of the quaint mountain town of Queen Valley that has all the necessities, about 32 miles SE of the larger city of Apache Junction, and 67 miles East of Phoenix, In Pinal County, Arizona. 

This historical area of the Superstition Mountains has the most desired claims and lives up to its reputation that is so widespread. 
The legend of the Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine centers around the Superstition Mountains. According to the legend, a German immigrant named Jacob Waltz discovered a mother lode of gold in the Superstition Wilderness and revealed its location on his deathbed in Phoenix in 1891 to Julia Thomas, a boarding-house owner who had taken care of him for many years.
Many since then, and even today, search for the Lost Dutchman Mine, including the TV series, Legends of the Superstition Mountains..

Another good sign for our claims here are the other experienced prospectors who have claims in this same area before us.

The washes on the claim are a great advantage for prospecting, especially when the summer rains run down the mountains and buttes depositing gold flakes into the washes.
Up the mountain buttes on the claim are good areas to explore for gems with your rock hammer.
Besides gold, this is also a great place to hunt for specimen rocks and other gemstones as agate and ruby red garnets are often found in this geological region.
Arrowheads and relics are often found in this area dating back to the Apaches.

The Superstition Mountains are a rock collectors heaven including an abundance of gemstones.
This area has one of the longest histories of gemstone production.
Arizona ranks first for where all of the natural gems are located and is famous for its turquoise and petrified wood.

ARIZONA ROCKHOUDING
Arizona is one of the best states in the United States for finding gemstones in the wild. Gemstones can be found all across the state of Arizona, and over eight main types of rocks and minerals can be collected there. Arizona is an incredible place to rockhound, not just because of its diversity of native gemstones but also because of its beautiful natural landscapes. 

Rockhounding is more than just a hobby; it is a lifestyle. Arizona is a fantastic place to find rocks, minerals, and crystals that can be displayed in a collection, made into jewelry, or sold to local jewelry and rock and mineral stores. There are also a variety of Arizona-based rock and gem shows that you can attend or even sell your own specimens.

You own the mineral rights, not sharing with others, on the 20.66 acres, and use your 20.66 acres, recreationally for camping: tent, camper, or RV, and prospecting, with beautiful views of nearby mountain ranges and rock formations. 
Great combination of good access with the town of Queen Valley nearby, wilderness beauty, and gold and gem prospecting potential. 

See the listing onsite pictures, showing one of the most beautiful areas in Arizona. 
This claim is surrounded by mountain views. Located in the Tonto National Forest and the Superstition Mountains.
Location Monument is a 4 foot wood post that has been placed, with an attached copy of our Location Notice, as required by the Arizona BLM.

For the possibility of constructing any building you or others could live in, you need to file a Plan of Operation with the BLM for approval, showing you have developed a full-time operation performing diligent mining, though the BLM is reluctant to approve anything to live in.
You do not need a plan, permission nor a permit to camp and prospect.
You do not need to be a full time prospector to file a Plan for a shed type structure.

With an approved BLM Plan of Operation, a building can be built on the land: any building that benefits and improves the claim, though is not likely anything to live in will be approved.
As stated by the BLM, this can be the ""construction of a building, road, fence, or enclosure necessary for mining.""
Current usage, is what the BLM calls, Casual Use: panning, shovel, rock hammer, metal detector, creek powered sluice box, where no permission nor permit is needed to camp and prospect.
You can prospect as little or as much as you like.
Now that we have located the claim, you never have to declare to the BLM any gold or gems you find.

On our trips to the claim, we found about 1/4 of an ounce of gold in the mineral vein running thru the claim and in the extended washes on the claim, value approx. $450. Those with more time to prospect may find more. 
Today's gold prices are over $1900/ounce. 
Though we could never guarantee what you will find, we did locate this claim in an historically rich area for gold prospecting.
We also found some nice specimens of crystals, fire agate, and chrysocolla.
I know of no more accessible areas in these mountains to locate a claim, as the whole area is claimed up, many being long time prospectors.
Gold prices have gone up $500 per ounce in the past few years.

You are allowed to post No Trespassing for Prospecting signs in and around the claim.
A mining claim owner may limit or restrict public recreational use of/or public access across claims or portions of claims that are actively used for prospecting, mining, or processing operations where public recreational use of a claim would endanger or materially interfere with legitimate mining pursuits.

20.66 acres = 600 ft. x 1500 ft.

This claim has a direct, national forest road access, areas for camping, and gold and gems discovered.
The claim is located on Hewitt Canyon Road, being one of the better roads in the Superstition Mountains.

This claim is in a very mineralized area, and is great for rock hounds, metal detecting, relic hunting, and dry-washing. Many historical gold rich producing mines are in this area, including the legend of the Lost Dutchman Mine, see links below. Canyon mountain views and rolling terrain. Pinal County is a region of broad desert plains and canyon mountain ranges. It is one of the largest areas of historic gold mining discoveries. Great views of the surrounding mountains and rock formations.

Our claim is in the Tonto National Forest, which embraces almost 3 million acres of rugged and spectacularly beautiful country, ranging from Saguaro cactus-studded desert to pine-forested mountains beneath the Mogollon Rim. This variety in vegetation and range in altitude (from 1,300 to 7,900 feet) offers outstanding recreational opportunities throughout the year, whether its lake beaches or cool pine forest. Hikers, backpackers, wildlife observers and photographers will find many recreation opportunities here. Rugged topography and the area's Hewitt Canyon furnishes the solitude and secluded experience treasured by many wilderness visitors. 

A transfer of ownership is a sale of legal, exclusive ownership of a mining claim site. 
To be a legally recorded claim, a valuable mineral had to be found on the claim, which was completed by us, as we are the original claim locators. 

Your ownership is legally conveyed via a Quit Claim deed, and legally recorded with the BLM and Pinal County. A Quit Claim deed is the required legal document per the BLM. 
Each year, on or before September 1st, you need to file a simple form with the Bureau of Land Management, along with $165. We will supply this form to you. 
You keep the claim forever by paying this annual fee.
Fee is paid, not due again until Sept. 1, 2023.
There are no taxes on mining claims in Arizona. 
You must be a current US citizen with a US address to own a mining claim in the US. 

An unpatented mining claim is a specific parcel of federal land, valuable for a specific mineral deposit or deposits. It is a parcel for which an individual has asserted a legal right of possession and the right to develop and extract a discovered, valuable, mineral deposit. Mining claims are real property that you can buy, sell, or inherit. After proving the existence of valuable minerals on the land, the claim is legally recorded with the Bureau of Land Management, and the Pinal County Recorder. 

Gold occurs in gravels in the metallic state and when so found has various physical characteristics. Gold is dense and heavy, it has a characteristic metallic color, and it is soft and easily malleable (it is easily formed by hammering). These are the characteristics used by prospectors to identify gold in the field.
Lode gold occurs on the claim usually in quartz veins derived from gossan formed by weathering, and oxidation of the gold, copper and iron rich veins. Gold is derived from the erosion of mineralized fault zones on the claim. 

The Federal Government owns the land. 
You are purchasing the mineral rights. 
You can legally camp for free, with camper and RV on the whole 20 .66 acres. 
A claim owner does not need permission nor a permit to camp and prospect.
Prospect, explore, and camp on the whole 20.66 acres. 
This is not a sharing of a mining claim: Is your exclusive ownership.

TERMS
To purchase our claim, the process would be, I would need your name(s) and mailing addresswhere I would scan and email you a signed contract, and which payment option you choose:

Total price of $3500, that can be paid in one full payment where your ownership is then transferred after receiving payment, 
or $3500, paying $1750 first month, and $1750 2nd month,
or $3500, paying $1500 first month, $1000 2nd month, and $1000 3rd month,
or $3500, paying $700 per month for 5 months,
or $4000, paying $500 per month for 8 months.
A $99 deed processing fee is paid with final payment.

Owner financing, No credit check. No interest charged
No down payment.
You can use the claim as yours while making monthly payments.
Ownership transfer after final monthly payment.
A signed contract will precede payment.

After your final monthly payment, I will process 2 notarized deeds, transferring my claim ownership over to you, with both the BLM and Pinal county. 

We live in Ohio. Our connection to the West is our daughter lives in Denver, though she is not involved with our claims, and we had a vacation home in Arizona; though now sold, we still go to AZ to explore, prospect, and locate claims, as we have been doing for a number of years. 

And just a note of encouragement for you if purchase:
My wife and I have located, prospected on, and sold mining claims in
California, Colorado, & Arizona, going on now for over 25 years.
You can trust we will process your notarized deeds correctly and quickly.
In that mining claims are processed thru the Bureau of Land Management, a
Federal Govt. agency, not following thru per our legally signed contract, would be a federal crime. I certainly will do what I say, and would never put myself nor my wife in any legal jeopardy.
Also, we have sold properties on 4 sites online for over 25 years:
Landsalelistings, Landwatch, LandandFarm, and LandsofAmerica.
Our continued good status on these sites is due to our always following thru, as just one time we would not, we would not be allowed to sell on these sites ever again.

COMMENTS FROM SATISFIED CLAIM BUYERS:

""We live in Arizona and purchased a mining claim from Mr. Leu.
The claim is everything as advertised.  The Superstition Mountains make for awesome views. We have camped on our claim a number of times and have found gold in the wash on our claim. We are very happy with our purchase.

Living in another state, we were a little skeptical on buying a mining claim in Arizona. But our personal experience with Mr. Leu has been a family blessing.
Our camping and prospecting on our claim has brought our family closer together.
We were so pleased, we bought a claim in Colorado from Mr. Leu, and are looking to buy one also in California as we look to plan family vacations around our claims. 

Thanks Michael. We took our girls to the campsite area closest to the claim last weekend.
It was a great experience. Were really looking forward to raising them up to be adventure seekers, nature loves and Creation appreciators. This claim has already brought and provided a wonderful experience for my family. Thank you so much for the claim purchase.",3500,20.66,N/A,".8.1, ",200,"https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966056,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966048,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966053,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966055,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966123,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966133,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966136,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966139,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966140,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966172,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966174,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966178,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966191,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966237,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966196,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966198,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966201,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966202,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966253,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966255,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966245,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966244,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966243,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966246,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966241,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966240,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966242,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966247,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966248,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966249,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113966252"

This is even better. You own a 5 acre Ranch Lot. You use it, enjoy it, build on it when you want to.   There is a creek running feet from your rear boundary.

Those 5 acres are for you and your family to enjoy forever. In this case because of the strategic location of your property you have the right to use and enjoy additional acres on either side of Trinchera creek. Meaning you can fish, ride your horses, walk your dog along the creek. You and your family can use and enjoy these extra acres without having to buy them, or pay taxes on them ( other than the $66 you pay for taxes on your 5 acre Ranch Lot). Is that sweet, or what?
You can lay back on your Ranch Lot (the size of 4 football fields), adjacent to a stream, in a quiet relaxing place where there are no traffic lights in sight, and no traffic congestion. You can wake up in the morning to the relaxing sounds of nature and a running stream. Here you will have no stress because in all likelihood this property will be yours. No mortgage with the bank. You own it!
This can be your castle. You are the boss. You can fish, hike, ski, hunt, golf,  whatever you like and enjoy, when you please.
Did I forget to mention that Gold Medal Fishing is available at the Rio Grande River which is only 6 miles from your property, or you can go boating and fish at nearby Smith Reservoir which is only 5 miles away.
You need to do a run to the market?. No problem. The town of Blanca is only 7 miles away, and Alamosa, a full-service city, is approximately 16 miles away.
You have heard the Real Estate saying, location, location, location. This is it! Oh did I forget to mention that this valley gets over 300 days of sunshine a year and that it is surrounded by mountains, ski Resorts, and National Forest Land?
If you are a fisherman, a hunter, or just a person who loves the outdoors. or a great deal? This could be your dream come true. Claim it!

Major recreation areas include the Copper Breaks State Park and Truscott Brine Lake. The elevation is approximately 1,473 ft above sea level and the economy is almost solely based upon agriculture. Conditions in the area make it suitable for growing wheat, cotton, and hay crops (alfalfa and cane).

Foard County
Foard County, in north central Texas on the rolling plains east of the base of the Panhandle, is bounded on the north by Hardeman County, on the west by Cottle County, on the south by Knox County, and on the east by Wilbarger and Baylor Counties. The Wichita River forms part of the southern boundary of the county, and the Pease River forms part of the northern border. Soils vary from deep sand in the east and along the Pease River in the north, to rich loam in the central section, and to rough pasture land in the south and west; the diversity of soils makes possible an unusual diversification in agriculture. Alongside oil and cattle, agriculture has remained a leading industry of Foard County, of which more than 4,000 acres are irrigated.

ARIZONA ROCKHOUDING
Arizona is one of the best states in the United States for finding gemstones in the wild. Gemstones can be found all across the state of Arizona, and over eight main types of rocks and minerals can be collected there. Arizona is an incredible place to rockhound, not just because of its diversity of native gemstones but also because of its beautiful natural landscapes. 

Rockhounding is more than just a hobby; it is a lifestyle. Arizona is a fantastic place to find rocks, minerals, and crystals that can be displayed in a collection, made into jewelry, or sold to local jewelry and rock and mineral stores. There are also a variety of Arizona-based rock and gem shows that you can attend or even sell your own specimens.

Arizona, The Grand Canyon State, is obviously no stranger to rocks and gemstones. 
Arizona is one of the highest caliber rockhounding states and receives visitors from all corners of the world in search of Arizona gold, rocks, gemstones, minerals and fossils which find themselves scattered across this geologic treasure trove.
Theres a reason that one of the largest gem and mineral shows in the world is held in Arizona. Every winter in Tucson, Arizona, exhibitors from all over the world come together to show off their collections of rocks, gemstones and minerals.

A huge, extended wash runs all the way thru the claim to multiply your gold prospecting potential.
This is a good place for gold, and the surrounding area of buttes and mountains are good places for gems.
For you off roaders, a jeep climb is in the area to test your adventure driving, known as the Diamond Back Sedona Hill Climb.

Owning a mining claim is having access to a lifetime of great family fun and recreation, in a very beautiful, natural setting: Arizona, is a great, scenic state, where the spirit of the old west still lives on. 
Mining Claims are also a great investment, as claims go up in value over time, just as land does.
if you purchase a claim from us, at no charge, I would help you if you ever decided to sell in the future.

Yavapai County where our claims are located in the central part of Arizona, ranks first historically in the State in gold production.
Our claims are in the same area of the Jerome (Verde) Mining District which has a history of being the largest gold producing area in Arizona, having contributed about 1,565,000 ounces of gold over the years, with the county history of gold discoveries being 3,800,000 ounces of gold.
Though mineral deposits were known in this area long before the Civil War, the first prospectors were Union soldiers with mining experience from California.

We are especially excited about the gems you will find in this area.
Known also as a gem area, when the rains start coming, Verde Valley rockhounds come running. The gem hunting in this area is so popular that a large club is active in Sedona.
Quartz is abundant and is also an area for crystals, turquoise, amethyst, jasper, agates, opals and some can be found above ground.
The Sedona Rockhounding Club has one area they explore being from Sedona stretching southwest to the town of Crown King.
Our claims are in this direct path for gem exploration.
We found quartz, agates, and crystals on this claim.

Having been to Sedona in the past and loving our experience, we looked to locate claims there.

The wash on the claim is a great advantage for prospecting, especially when the summer rains run down the washes, then depositing gold flakes down from the mountains and rock formations, and which also exposes gem veins.

This is a 20 acre unpatented, gold and gem mining claim, the Sedona Rockhound #4. 
The claim is legally registered with the Bureau of Land Management out of Phoenix and the Yavapai County Recorder. You own the mineral rights, not sharing with others, on the 20 acres. There are eight, large, cleared dispersed camping areas to choose from in the area.

Yavapai County is one of the four original Arizona counties formed in September of 1864, one year after the Arizona Territory was established. The County was named after the Yavapai Tribe, whose name means the people of the sun.
Yavapai County is a land of deep character and changing terrain. Views are far-reaching capped by clear blue skies. Prehistoric remains of the Sinaguan people are tucked into sandstone ledges and prominent hilltops. Area lakes are nestled in the pines surrounded by thousands of miles of hiking, biking, and horseback riding trails. The real spirit of the West is fully alive in this timeless territory.

Sedona is red rock country. Multi-hued stone formations jut upwards from the high desert floor creating a vivid, mesmerizing setting that changes hourly with the light. When USA Weekend compiled their Most Beautiful Places in America list, Sedona claimed the top spot. Surrounded by 1.8 million acres of national forest land, visitors have instant access to recreational activities. Trails for hiking and biking, along with bouncy jeep tracks, weave among the bristling forest of pinnacles, spires, buttes and domes. Yet, you are never far from the indulgences of town.
Sedona is equal parts rugged, equal parts resort. Regarded by Native Americans as sacred, Sedona continues to be recognized as a place of healing and spiritual renewal. Many come to experience the vortex energy centers of Sedona. Others want to prowl the 40-plus art galleries lining the streets, or to receive soothing treatments from the dozens of spa facilities. Most recently, with its nearby vineyards and tasting rooms, Sedona has emerged as a destination for wine enthusiasts.
Many Westerns have been filmed in this area, going back to the late, great John Wayne.

The Grand Canyon is 2 hours north, and there are day tours out of Sedona.

It is a parcel for which an individual has asserted a legal right of possession and the right to develop and extract a discovered, valuable, mineral deposit. Mining claims are real property that you can buy, sell, or inherit. After proving the existence of valuable minerals on the land, the claim is legally recorded with the Bureau of Land Management, and Yavapai County.

Gold always occurs in gravels in the metallic state and when so found has various physical characteristics. Gold is dense and heavy, it has a characteristic metallic color, and it is soft and easily malleable (it is easily formed by hammering). These are the characteristics used by prospectors to identify gold in the field. Placer gold occurs on the claim as small grains derived from gossan formed by weathering, and oxidation of the gold, copper and iron rich veins. Gold also occurs as grains flakes and small nuggets derived from the erosion of mineralized fault zones.

COMMENTS FROM SATISFIED CLAIM BUYERS:

""We live in Arizona and purchased a mining claim from Mr. Leu.
The claim is everything as advertised.  The area red rock formations make for awesome views. We have camped on our claim a number of times and have found gold in the wash on our claim and a lot of gems on the claim buttes. We are very happy with our purchase.

Living in another state, we were a little skeptical on buying a mining claim in Arizona. But our personal experience with Mr. Leu has been a family blessing.
Our camping and prospecting on our claim has brought our family closer together.

Property is 0.381 acres, but effectively is likely less level terrain at the top near the road due to erosion.  It also is effectively much more acreage counting the area between the bank and river especially when the river is low.  The proximity to the bank may not allow for permanent structure or residence, but a small cabin or spot to camp or park an RV is possible.  The final 100 ft or so to the property is mostly grass road and may be muddy/rutted when it rains.

This is a legally registered, 20.66 acre gold and gem LODE Mining Claim for sale, the Resolution Mountain Lode #1, located on Resolution Mountain with road access.
Our claim here is about 24 miles south of the resort town of Vail, in Eagle County, Colorado.
About 9 miles south of the quaint mountain town of Red Cliff.

This is our last lode claim in this area, unique in being located at the base of the mineral rich Resolution Mountain.

There is a vein of a valuable minerals running thru the whole claim, in this case, quartz, gold, smoky quartz and fluorite.
You can also prospect on the whole claim, including the claim ridges ...You can also prospect on the whole claim, including the claim ridges for gems outside the lode mineral vein.
A lode claim has the most potential for finding valuable minerals.

A lode claim differs from our placer claims, as on a lode claim you can dig into the mountain side and can even go to the extent of building a mine shaft.
Having a lode claim is an advantage as you can dig into the claim with a shaft if you choose,
and the nearby creek has some good trout fishing.

Our lode claim has veins of valuable minerals including gold in veins (called lodes) cutting thru rocks. 
Quartz and gold are frequently found together and digging into the quartz vein is called chasing the vein.
Veins of quartz, smoky quartz, and fluorite are on the claim.

Beautifully forested area of pines and aspens.
Large open camping areas are by the claim with a side road to one of them for more privacy.
Known as a great snowmobiling area. See Trail Map with the pictures.
Also known as the moose viewing capitol of Colorado.

It is also great sign here that the federal govt. has withdrawn nearby areas for minerals and our claims here are located in this mineral rich area.
Located in the Vail Pass Winter Recreation Area allowing for winter access for snowmobiling, cross country skiing, and snowshoeing. 

National Forests remained open at all times during the virus with a televised invitation by the Director for families to visit them as safe places for family recreation, making our mining claims some of the safest places for your family to enjoy and get away from all the nonsense.

Rockhounding in Colorado 
Starting with the rich gold and silver deposits which were the starting point of so many Colorado towns, the Centennial State, with over 770 types of minerals to be found, is second only to California in the number of different gems and minerals statewide.
Colorado is also host to a dizzying array of rocks and minerals. Some of the higher profile include dinosaur fossils.
Colorado can certainly be considered a rockhound and gem hunters dream. 
The vast mountains of national forests gives one a newfound sense of exploration and discovery.

Eagle County has a rich history associated with all that makes the West the West. Native American culture, mining, agriculture, ranching and recreation all have played important roles in the countys past.   
In 1865 the immortal Lincoln sent a special message to the miners of the West. He said: ""Tell the miners for me, I shall promote their interests to the best of my ability, because their prosperity is the prosperity of the nation, and we shall prove in a very few years that we are indeed the treasury of the world. How substantially this prophecy has been fulfilled is demonstrated in the ever increasing output in gold, silver and other metals in the great West, of which Colorado is the greatest state.
Eagle county has done her share to swell the annual mineral production of the state since 1879, and it may be said the growth of the county was based on the mining industry.
Gold prices reached an all time high of $2000 per ounce:

I am a retired teacher, and got into prospecting as a hobby with my family.
I am 71 and my wife 69, and we have gained the experience to select the best areas to locate claims.

We feel we are selling more than the gold and minerals on beautiful land.

Mining Claims are a great investment, as claims go up in value over time, just as land does.

Gold and gems discovered in our own prospecting along with the beauty of the area, makes for awesome camping and prospecting.

Owning a mining claim is having access to a lifetime of great family fun and recreation, in a very beautiful, natural setting.

This is a 20 acre unpatented, gold and gem mining lode claim, the Resolution Mountain Lode #1 claim, in the Rocky Mountains and the White River National Forest. 
The claim is legally registered with the Bureau of Land Management out of Lakewood, CO and Eagle County. You own the mineral rights, not sharing with others, on the 20.66 acres, and use your 20.66 acres recreationally for camping and prospecting in an awesome, beautiful area.

For the possibility of constructing any building you for others could live in, you need to file a Plan of Operation with the BLM for approval, showing you have developed a full-time operation performing diligent mining, though the BLM is reluctant to approve anything to live in. 
You do not need a plan, permission nor a permit to camp and prospect.
You do not need to be a full time prospector to file a Plan for a shed type structure.

With an approved BLM Plan of Operation, a building can be built on the land: any building that benefits and improves the claim, though you cannot live on a mining claim. 
As stated by the BLM, this can be the ""construction of a building, road, fence, or enclosure necessary for mining.""
Current usage, is what the BLM calls, Casual Use: panning, shovel, rock hammer, metal detector, creek powered sluice box, where no permission nor permit is needed to camp and prospect.

On our visits to the claim, we gathered in the mineral vein, approx. 1/8 of an ounce of gold, being worth about $225. As the BLM does not specify the amount of gold to be found to locate a claim other than gold needs to be discovered, we use this amount for a 20 acre claim as a projection of good gold potential. Someone with more time may find more. Gold prices are over $1900/ounce. Though we could never guarantee what you will find, we did locate this claim in an historically rich area for gold and gem prospecting.
Gold in 3 years has gone up $400 per ounce.

You are allowed to post No Trespassing for Prospecting signs in and around the claim.
A mining claim owner may limit or restrict public recreational use of/or public access across claims or portions of claims that are actively used for prospecting, mining, or processing operations where public recreational use of a claim would endanger or materially interfere with legitimate mining pursuits.

Camp by your claim or nearby national forest campgrounds.
A claim owner does not need permission nor a permit to camp and prospect.
You can prospect as little or as much as you like.
Now that we have located the claims, you never have to declare to the BLM any gold or gems you find.

Eagle County, named for the Eagle River that runs thru the town of Eagle, is rich with trails, byways, protected forests and wilderness areas. Much of Eagle County is comprised of theWhite River National Forest. The Bureau of Land Management oversees much of the remainder of the land.
When visiting Eagle County, its easy to get caught up in the resort mindset However, if you want a change of scenery, find that small town, Americana setting in Eagle Countys small towns. The welcoming, down to earth vibe seems more like something from a storybook than a travel brochure, and the things to do in Eagle County embrace this. 
People go out for walks about town and greet passersby. If you take a break between your days activities, do as the locals do and hang out in a coffee shop. Like most of Eagle County, outdoor activities reign supreme year round.
During the summer, things to do often include hiking, golfing, fishing and visiting parks. Spice things up a bit with a hot air balloon trip or paleontological project at a fossil dig site. When winter sets in, trade your hiking boots for skis. If youd rather skate, then head to a town park that the town floods every winter to create a picture perfect ice skating rink. 
For indoor Eagle County things to do, try touring a brewery, winery or distillery, practice your craft at a local art studio or round up your crew for a night of bowling.

Eagle County has the feeling of the Old West and is away from all the crowds, noise, and traffic jams of large cities.

Being on Resolution Mountain is a unique advantage for lode gold prospecting.
Gold occurs in gravels in the metallic state and when so found has various physical characteristics. Gold is dense and heavy, it has a characteristic metallic color, and it is soft and easily malleable (it is easily formed by hammering). These are the characteristics used by prospectors to identify gold in the field.
Lode gold occurs on the claim usually in quartz veins derived from gossan formed by weathering, and oxidation of the gold, copper and iron rich veins. Gold is derived from the erosion of mineralized fault zones on the claim.

After receiving your final payment, your ownership of the 20.66 acre claim will be legally recorded with the local Bureau of Land Management and Eagle County. The quit claim deed is the correct document to be recorded for a mining claim, as stated by the BLM. 
This is not a sharing with others of your 20.66 acre claim.

We live in Ohio. Our connection to Colorado is our daughter lives in Denver, though she is not involved with our claims. We visited her in September, then went to prospect and locate mining claims, as we have been doing for a number of years.

And just a note of encouragement for you if purchase:
My wife and I have located, prospected on, and sold mining claims in 
California, Colorado, Arizona, and now also Montana, Wyoming, and South Dakota, for now over 25 years.
You can trust we will process your notarized deeds correctly and quickly.
In that mining claims are processed thru the Bureau of Land Management, a Federal Govt. agency, not following thru per our legally signed contract, would be a federal crime. I certainly will do what I say, and would never put myself nor my wife in any legal jeopardy.
Also, we have sold properties on 4 sites online for over 25 years:
Landsalelistings, Landwatch, LandsofAmerica, and LandandFarm.
Our continued good status on these sites is due to our always following thru, as just one time we would not, we would not be allowed to sell on these sites ever again.

COMMENTS FROM SATISFIED CLAIM BUYERS:

""Living in Colorado, the purchase of our mining claim from you has been great for family fun and recreation. We have camped overnight a number of times, and panned for gold in the creek. We were even able to find gold flakes on several of our attempts. Thank you so much!.""

""We purchased a 40 acre claim in California from Mr. Leu. Our claim is everything he told us it would be: Beautiful area, great for family camping outings, and, we have found gold while panning in the creek on our claim. We could not be happier with our purchase!""

""We purchased 2 mining claims from Michael Leu over the last 2 years, one in California, and one In Colorado. We have been to our claims on several occasions, and we could not be happier! They are exactly as described, and our camping on our claims and prospecting in the creek on each claim is the highlight of our vacations. You can trust Mr. Leu. If you are looking for a great time in the awesome beauty of the west, buying a mining claim from Mr. Leu will be a blessing.""",3500,20.66,N/A,".9.120., ",200,"https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113502193,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095064743,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095059832,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095060063,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095059635,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095064742,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095060488,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095060941,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095061826,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095062104,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095064325,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095064750,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095064752,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095064753,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095064754,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095064755,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4103304130,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4103304129,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095064768,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095064800,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095064827"

Estancia Ranchettes is easy to find right off exit 203 on I-40. Currently, several residents call it home. The land is relatively flat with beautiful views of the Sandia Mountains to the northwest and Manzano Mountains to the south.  All lots have road frontage. This is a legally recorded subdivision so you have guaranteed legal access to lots through road or easements, so no parcel is landlocked.

Moriarty and Edgewood
The east valley is the fastest growing area near Albuquerque. Edgewood's population grew 97% between 2000 and 2010, and has had slower, but steady growth since. Both commercial and residential real estate are being snatched up as soon as it hits the market. Now is your chance to own a piece of the area before prices skyrocket. 

The Moriarty/Edgewood area is less than a 30 minute drive to the Albuquer...The Moriarty/Edgewood area is less than a 30 minute drive to the Albuquerque city limits and less than 50 miles from Santa Fe! Much of the growth has been related to the expanding Albuquerque Metropolitan Area.

The east valley provides an exciting environment in which to live, work, or own a business. With a robust economy, rapidly growing regional population, and excellent transportation infrastructure, it provides convenient access to the Albuquerque market as well as those of Santa Fe, Estancia, and Mountainair. Much of the regional population east of Albuquerque comes to either Moriarty or Edgewood for shopping, dining, and entertainment.

Citizens and guests can also bowl, pitch horseshoes, and play miniature golf. The town has several stores, a library, three resorts, a community theater, a spa, and several restaurants.
 
The citizens of Horseshoe Bend take pride in the community spirit and the ability to offer a memorable experience for all who come to visit. The Music in the Mountains show occurs every third Saturday of the month, and during summer, the Farmers Market occurs every Wednesday. Every year, the town celebrates Dogwood Days on the second Saturday of May, and Independence Day is celebrated every 4th of July with a parade and fireworks. The annual Christmas parade occurs on the first Saturday in December. There are many more events that happen throughout the year, thanks to the numerous civic groups which are active in Horseshoe Bend. All of these events embrace the unique Ozark culture of small-town pride and fellowship.
 
The largest town in Izard County with 2,180 residents, Horseshoe Bend is accessible to the states most scenic highways. The town is centrally located and just a 3-hour drive to Little Rock, Memphis, and Springfield. With its gorgeous views, slower pace of life, and laid-back charm, Horseshoe Bend is the perfect place to stay a week or a lifetime.

There are side roads off the main road that lead into the claim to secluded camping spots.
Large washes run thru the claim being good places for gold,
Up the mountain ridge and the buttes on the claim are good places for gems.
A camping spot is also by Apache Land Tank, a pond.

National Forests remained open at all times during the virus with a televised invitation by the Director for families to visit them as safe places for family recreation, making our mining claims some of the safest places for your family to enjoy and get away from all the nonsense.

Direct road access on Apache Land Road, with a side road that goes all the way across the claim,
A large mountain is on the southern part of the claim,
Located 11 miles SE of the quaint mountain town of Gold Canyon that has all the necessities, about 17 miles SE of the larger city of Apache Junction, and 57 miles East of Phoenix, In Pinal County, Arizona. 

This historical area of the Superstition Mountains has the most desired claims and lives up to its reputation that is so widespread. 
The legend of the Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine centers around the Superstition Mountains. According to the legend, a German immigrant named Jacob Waltz discovered a mother lode of gold in the Superstition Wilderness and revealed its location on his deathbed in Phoenix in 1891 to Julia Thomas, a boarding-house owner who had taken care of him for many years.
Many since then, and even today, search for the Lost Dutchman Mine, including the TV series, Legends of the Superstition Mountains.

Another good sign for our claims here are the other experienced prospectors who have claims in this same area before us.

Large, extended washes run thru the claim being good places for gold deposits.
The washes on the claim are a great advantage for prospecting, especially when the summer rains run down the wash, then depositing gold flakes down from the mountains, buttes, and rock formations.

Up the mountain on the claim is a good area to explore for gems with your rock hammer.
Besides gold, this is also a great place to hunt for specimen rocks and other gemstones as agate and ruby red garnets are often found in this geological region.
Arrowheads and relics are often found in this area dating back to the Apaches.

The Superstition Mountains are a rock collectors heaven including an abundance of gemstones.
This area has one of the longest histories of gemstone production.
Arizona ranks first for where all of the natural gems are located and is famous for its turquoise and petrified wood.

ARIZONA ROCKHOUDING
Arizona is one of the best states in the United States for finding gemstones in the wild. Gemstones can be found all across the state of Arizona, and over eight main types of rocks and minerals can be collected there. Arizona is an incredible place to rockhound, not just because of its diversity of native gemstones but also because of its beautiful natural landscapes. 

Rockhounding is more than just a hobby; it is a lifestyle. Arizona is a fantastic place to find rocks, minerals, and crystals that can be displayed in a collection, made into jewelry, or sold to local jewelry and rock and mineral stores. There are also a variety of Arizona-based rock and gem shows that you can attend or even sell your own specimens.

Current usage, is what the BLM calls, Casual Use: panning, shovel, rock hammer, metal detector, creek powered sluice box, where no permission nor permit is needed to camp and prospect.
You can prospect as little or as much as you like.
Now that we have located the claim, you never have to declare to the BLM any gold or gems you find.

On our trips to the claim, we found about 1/8 of an ounce of gold in and around the extended wash on the claim, value approx. $225. Those with more time to prospect may find more. Today's gold prices are over $1600/ounce. 
Though we could never guarantee what you will find, we did locate this claim in an historically rich area for gold prospecting.
We also found some nice specimens of crystals, fire agate, and chrysocolla.
I know of no more accessible areas in these mountains to locate a claim, as the whole area is claimed up, many being long time prospectors.
Gold prices have gone up $400 per ounce in the past few years.

You are allowed to post No Trespassing for Prospecting signs in and around the claim.
A mining claim owner may limit or restrict public recreational use of/or public access across claims or portions of claims that are actively used for prospecting, mining, or processing operations where public recreational use of a claim would endanger or materially interfere with legitimate mining pursuits.

20 acres = 660 ft. x 1320 ft.

This claim has a direct, national forest road access, areas for camping, and gold and gems discovered in surface prospecting.

Your 20 acres is the West 1/2 of the SW 1/4 of the SE 1/4 of Section 29, Township 1 S, Range 10E, G&SR Meridian, known as the Superstition Legend #1 mining claim, located in Pinal County, Arizona.  Claim number: AZ105787841

This claim is in a very mineralized area, and is great for rock hounds, metal detecting, relic hunting, and dry-washing. Many historical gold rich producing mines are in this area, including the legend of the Lost Dutchman Mine, see links below. Canyon mountain views and rolling terrain. Pinal County is a region of broad desert plains and canyon mountain ranges. It is one of the largest areas of historic gold mining discoveries. Great views of the surrounding mountains and rock formations.

Our claim is in the Tonto National Forest, which embraces almost 3 million acres of rugged and spectacularly beautiful country, ranging from Saguaro cactus-studded desert to pine-forested mountains beneath the Mogollon Rim. This variety in vegetation and range in altitude (from 1,300 to 7,900 feet) offers outstanding recreational opportunities throughout the year, whether its lake beaches or cool pine forest. Hikers, backpackers, wildlife observers and photographers will find many recreation opportunities here. Rugged topography and the area's Hewitt Canyon furnishes the solitude and secluded experience treasured by many wilderness visitors. 
The town of Queen Valley is a 11 miles south of the claim which has a store and gas station, and the larger Apache Junction is about 30 miles, off of route 60, just before the N. Queen Valley turnoff. 

A transfer of ownership is a sale of legal, exclusive ownership of a mining claim site. To be a legally recorded claim, gold had to be found on the claim, which was completed by us, as we are the original claim locators. 

Your ownership is legally conveyed via a Quit Claim deed, and legally recorded with the BLM and Pinal County. A Quit Claim deed is the required legal document per the BLM. 
Each year, on or before September 1st, you need to file a simple form with the Bureau of Land Management, along with $165. We will supply this form to you. 
You keep the claim forever by paying this annual fee.
Fee is paid, not due again until Sept. 1, 2023.
There are no taxes on mining claims in Arizona. 
You must be a current US citizen with a US address to own a mining claim in the US. 

An unpatented mining claim is a specific parcel of federal land, valuable for a specific mineral deposit or deposits. It is a parcel for which an individual has asserted a legal right of possession and the right to develop and extract a discovered, valuable, mineral deposit. Mining claims are real property that you can buy, sell, or inherit. After proving the existence of valuable minerals on the land, the claim is legally recorded with the Bureau of Land Management, and Pinal county. 

Gold always occurs in gravels in the metallic state and when so found has various physical characteristics. Gold is dense and heavy, it has a characteristic metallic color, and it is soft and easily malleable (it is easily formed by hammering). These are the characteristics used by prospectors to identify gold in the field. Placer gold occurs on the claim as small grains derived from gossan formed by weathering, and oxidation of the gold, copper and iron rich veins. Gold also occurs as grains flakes and small nuggets derived from the erosion of mineralized fault zones. 

The Federal Government owns the land. 
You are purchasing the mineral rights. 
You can legally camp for free, with camper and RV on the whole 20 acres. 
A claim owner does not need permission nor a permit to camp and prospect.
Prospect, explore, and camp on the whole 20 acres. 
This is not a sharing of a mining claim: Is your exclusive ownership.

TERMS
To purchase our claim, the process would be, I would need your name(s) and mailing addresswhere I would scan and email you a signed contract, and which payment option you choose:

Total price of $3500, that can be paid in one full payment where your ownership is then transferred after receiving payment, 
or $3500, paying $1750 first month, and $1750 2nd month,
or $3500, paying $1500 first month, $1000 2nd month, and $1000 3rd month.
or, $3500, paying $700 per month for 5 months,
A $99 deed processing fee is paid with final payment.

Owner financing, No credit check. No interest charged
No down payment.
You can use the claim as yours while making monthly payments.
Ownership transfer after final monthly payment.
A signed contract will precede payment.

After your final monthly payment, I will process 2 notarized deeds, transferring my claim ownership over to you, with both the BLM and Pinal county. 

We live in Ohio.. Our connection to the West is our daughter lives in Denver, though she is not involved with our claims, and we had a vacation home in Arizona; though now sold, we still go to AZ to explore, prospect, and locate claims, as we have been doing for a number of years. 

And just a note of encouragement for you if purchase:
My wife and I have located, prospected on, and sold mining claims in
California, Colorado, & Arizona, going on now for over 25 years.
You can trust we will process your notarized deeds correctly and quickly.
In that mining claims are processed thru the Bureau of Land Management, a
Federal Govt. agency, not following thru per our legally signed contract, would be a federal crime. I certainly will do what I say, and would never put myself nor my wife in any legal jeopardy.
Also, we have sold properties on 4 sites online for over 25 years:
Landsalelistings, Landwatch, LandandFarm, and LandsofAmerica.
Our continued good status on these sites is due to our always following thru, as just one time we would not, we would not be allowed to sell on these sites ever again.

COMMENTS FROM SATISFIED CLAIM BUYERS:

""We live in Arizona and purchased a mining claim from Mr. Leu.
The claim is everything as advertised.  The Superstition Mountains make for awesome views. We have camped on our claim a number of times and have found gold in the wash on our claim. We are very happy with our purchase.

Living in another state, we were a little skeptical on buying a mining claim in Arizona. But our personal experience with Mr. Leu has been a family blessing.
Our camping and prospecting on our claim has brought our family closer together.
We were so pleased, we bought a claim in Colorado from Mr. Leu, and are looking to buy one also in California as we look to plan family vacations around our claims. 

Thanks Michael. We took our girls to the campsite area closest to the claim last weekend.
It was a great experience. Were really looking forward to raising them up to be adventure seekers, nature loves and Creation appreciators. This claim has already brought and provided a wonderful experience for my family. Thank you so much for the claim purchase.",3500,20,N/A,".6.1, ",200,"https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110469744,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110469745,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110469768,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110469866,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110486295,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110470577,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110470164,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110476608,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110477424,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110477487,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110478650,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110480975,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110479799,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110480866,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110482871,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110484339,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110484590,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110483116,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110483452,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110486294,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110485613,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110486296,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110486300,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110486303,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110492066,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4110486305"

Apache County sits in north eastern Arizona. If you are not familiar with this part of Arizona, it is definitely different from the high heat of Phoenix and Tucson. It even gets some snow in the winter time! Some of the land has trees. Being away from the big city there is a lot of open land and the price is right!

Apache County is also known for having some of the fewest restrictions of any county in Arizona. Unlike some other places, there are no specific regulations for camping. If you are going to be on your land for more than 30 days, however, the sanitation department will want to make sure you have a septic system. Most of the land in the county is generally zoned as agricultural which gives you lots of options on what to do with the land.

Many lots in Apache county do not have utilities. Some people find ...Many lots in Apache county do not have utilities. Some people find that solar is a good option. Water is often hauled in or delivered. Property taxes are low, although part of that is because the county only maintains certain roads. There are other roads, called N roads that are not maintained. Some of them are better than others. You may need an all-wheel drive vehicle to get to some places and it may also depend on the weather.

One attraction to check out is the beautiful Petrified Forest National Park. There are also several National Forests that are not too far away: Apache-Sitgraves, Coconino, Prescott, Kaibab, and Gila National Forests. 

This particular property is 1.83 acres and is not far from the small town of Sanders. It is accessible via Interstate 40, US Highway 191 and county roads!

Shellman Bluff is a peaceful, picturesque fish camp village that retains its distinctive charm. Quaint, screened fishing cottages sit back among oaks festooned with Spanish moss. All the dirt roads of the quiet village seem to lead inevitably to the high bluff that overlooks the Broro and Julienton rivers. Winding along the edge of the high bluff is another sandy road that offers one of the best coastal views in Georgia. In the morning, the sun rises from behind Harris Neck, lighting the green marsh and dappling the tidal rivers while birds roost in distant hammock islands.

Weeping Live Oaks dot the lush landscape, teeming with nature and wetlands and framing broad vistas of marsh and water. Whitetail deer and fox raise their heads from the brush while osprey, wood storks, egrets and great blue herons drop from the sky into the marsh.

Some of the best fishing on the Atlantic Coast is close by on Sapelo Sound, calling you from the deep water dock and boardwalk at the White Chimney River.  A short boat trip yields the Intracoastal Waterway and the broad, pristine beaches of the Golden Isles of Georgia.

This property is located in Christmas Valley, really close to the Lake and just a few minutes away from shops, stores, gas, golf course and other amenities at your convenience.

The town of Christmas Valley (population 1,313) is little more than a few small restaurants, a pair of motels and a gas station. But spend a few days driving the bumpy gravel roads that lead off in all directions, and you'll find a pocket of fascinating natural attractions: cracks, craters, sand dunes and volcanic glass.

Some are well-established recreation sites with amenities nearby, but most remain relatively obscure. These are not places you stumble upon, but places you actively seek out. Discover the growing Christmas Valley.

This area is known for its beautiful forest of pine, cedar and juniper trees. Three fishing ponds are nestled in among the trees and are stocked by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife. Seasonal streams and a variety of springs also dot the hillside. Property owners will have unlimited use of all campgrounds, fishing ponds and recreational facilities in the California Pines subdivision.

The topography is diverse, ranging from the forested Warner Mountain range in the east, to the high plateaus dominated by sage steppe and ancient lava flows around Alturas, and culminating at the Medicine Highlands (the largest shield volcano in North America) in the west.

The high desert climate in the valley areas consists of four distinct seasons and an average precipitation of 13 inches, a large part of which comes in the form of snow during the winter months of December to March. Elevation levels in the Modoc range from 9,906 feet at Eagle Peak in the South Warner Wilderness, to 4,000 feet in the valleys.

There are ample opportunities for hiking, backpacking, horseback riding, hunting and fishing. The Modoc is home of more than 300 species of wildlife. The Pacific Flyway crosses directly over the area. During their migration from Alaska and Canada to Mexico, hundreds of thousands of waterfowl use local wetlands as rest stops. Rocky Mountain elk, wild horses, mule deer, and pronghorn antelope are some of the large, unique mammals that call the Modoc their home.

Purchase options:

6-year financing: $200 down payment, then $200/month for 72 months. Total price of $14,600.

https://www.landwatch.com/culberson-county-texas-undeveloped-land-for-sale/pid/415317330,Available,"10, unrestricted, do whatever-you-want acres in West Texas.

I bought this property before the 2016 election as a place I could pay for with cash, that I could go to in case things got really bad. I've been to the property a number of times, though not in a couple of years. I also explored Terlingua and Presidio area in my property search. Funny enough, I bought the place unseen, but I knew more or less what I was getting into.

I bought a travel trailer and towed it out to the property. The travel trailer was in rough shape. At the time I had the idea that I should keep my trash where I live, which was a terrible idea. So there's quite a bit of trash there. Since then I've wisened up, but I live days away so have no way to clean it up.

Unlike many properties in the area, I've been there. It has an address (it's not hard to get an address, but it's another step). It has access.

West Te...West Texas is not for everyone. It has strong sun and hot summers. This property thanks to its elevation, does cool down more at night than say the lower elevation areas in Terlingua. It can also rain quite a bit and things will really green up.

But all in all, this is 10 acres with a sketchy travel trailer with a big hole cut into it, and trash. One room, 7'x4' in the trailer has been ""remodeled."" As I haven't been there in years, I don't know if it's been consumed by spiders, bees, rats, etc. So you'd probably just want to clear out the trash (there's dumpsters in town, 20 minutes away) and build.

This is a great place for solar, of course. Just make sure your panels don't fly away as it is windy (so also good for wind power). The property is generally flat, with little hills (a few feet tall). The sand is mostly sand and there's mesquite everywhere. The mesquite has nasty thorns that will ruin most tires. There's a reason oil field workers in the area gravitate to heavy duty tires, like the Cooper STT MAXX. But any LT tire may be okay. Just your standard passenger car tires can be punctured pretty easily by the thorns.

There's no gravel or improvements. There's multiple ""paths"" in and around, that may or may not have grown over.

What's really nice is that it's a few minutes to the interstate. I've gotten to the middle of Van Horn in less than 20 minutes, from the property. This does mean it's not super private, but it's also far enough from the interstate that people aren't going to be able to make out much detail. One benefit of being by the interstate is that there is some cell service. You may need a cell booster, but I'm sure with a carrier you can make it work.

There's no natural gas/water/electricity to the property.

I've found 3 survey stakes at the property's corners. Had no idea it was surveyed before, but suspect a number of properties in the area may be surveyed. The stakes can be hard to find.

A bit of background. This land is part of the Southwest Sunsites. Some developer bought up the land, probably as a huge ranch, and sold off parcels. The FTC sued them in the 70s for misrepresenting the land. From what I understand, they went under, and any covenants on the land are null and void. I know of no claim on the minerals, but if this is important to you, please do your own research! I assume they are included but I do not know for sure.

Van Horn itself has groceries, a NAPA, places to eat, a hardware store, and a number of hotels. It also has truck stops which are cheap places to shower at until you have your own.

Speaking of water, I hear water is down pretty deep, like hundreds of feet. So while power may not be a challenge with solar, a deep well may be. Most people say the water in the area is good. Rain catchment is another option.

Have encountered people hunting for hogs in the area. Did see a mountain lion once. There's a really cute native mouse in the area. I haven't found them to be destructive, unlike the rats that came on my travel trailer. From what I understand I took care of the non-native rat population, but they could also be back. Don't know what they'd live on, though.

The travel trailer might have a damaged title not in my name somewhere in it. But I'd count on it not being there.

So with this property, you win some and you lose some. There's trash and stuff to get rid of. But, there's actual pictures. There's a real person who's been there. You know what you're getting. As long as you are okay with West Texas life and want bare land, this is not, in my opinion, a bad option if it's a good location for you. There's more remote and less remote properties, but it also lets you visit the land more easily from the interstate (as long as your tires are up for it!).

The parcel ID is 9919. It's in Culberson County. Again, no building codes, zoning, known deed restrictions, etc.

As much as I'd love to come back and visit the place, I have roots now and I'm far away. Maybe someone adventurous wants to give it a go out there.

PS: The photos show various things at the property. The land is sold as-is, with whatever is left or not left on it! No value is implied by the trailer, trash, etc. It's just showing what I've done at the property over time. There's no motorcycles. The popup tent is probably long gone. I think even the single mattress is gone and I ended up converting that ""remodeled"" room into storage. I don't even know if I still have a key for it, you might have to break in. If it's still even there. If you're lucky, there may be some old water bottles inside.

This is being sold for the land only! Anything else on it is yours, however.",12000,10,N/A,"31.067850000000000, -104.590609999999998",200,"https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112274584,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112274590,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112274589,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112274591,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112274592,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112274812,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112274814,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112274815,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112274817,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112274818,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112274819,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112274820,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112274821,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112274823,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112274824,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112274826,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112287334"

The town takes pride in its welcoming character and sense of community, which many believe is lacking in most other towns and cities that have failed to stay loyal to their roots. In many respects, St. Johns, which is only a half-day trip from Phoenix, is like another universe. You'll want to keep this 1.55 acre all to yourself.

It's a fantastic area to invest and live in!

Arizona Bell Ranch is located under five miles north of Willcox, Arizona. Unlike many areas in Cochise County, there is development in this subdivision. This lot lies just south of Saddle Road and measures a total of one acre. It is buildable, and NOT in a flood zone. This is a great area to either build or simply start your land portfolio at an affordable price.  

City of Willcox
The air is unpolluted, the water is pure, the temperatures are moderate, and the sunsets are spectacular. Willcox has plenty of things to keep everyone busy from outdoor recreation such as hiking, biking, camping; bird watching to beautiful sunsets. Historic downtown Willcox is home to some of Willcox Wine Country tasting rooms, interesting shops, restaurants, museums, and great people.

Originally known as ""Maley"", the town was founded in...Originally known as ""Maley"", the town was founded in 1880 as a whistlestop on the Southern Pacific Railroad. It was renamed in honor of a visit by General Orlando B. Willcox in 1889. The town was incorporated in 1915. In the early 20th century, Willcox had the distinction of being a national leader in cattle production. Agriculture remains important to the local economy, and Willcox has maintained its rural lifestyle through a strong agricultural and ranching economy.

Cochise County
Home to Tombstone, Cochise County has over 130,000 residents. Area industries include copper, cattle, cotton and silver. In the county's largest city, Sierra Vista, US Army Intelligence Center Fort Huachuca helps to contribute to an already strong economy. While the county may be large in size (as large as Connecticut and Rhode Island combined), you will find more similarities than differences as you traverse the area.

Much of the growth has been related to the expanding Albuquerque Metropolitan Area.

The east valley provides an exciting environment in which to live, work, or own a business. With a robust economy, rapidly growing regional population, and excellent transportation infrastructure, it provides convenient access to the Albuquerque market as well as those of Santa Fe, Estancia, and Mountainair. Much of the regional population east of Albuquerque comes to either Moriarty or Edgewood for shopping, dining, and entertainment.

This is a legally registered, 20.66 acre gold and gem LODE Mining Claim for sale, the South Meadow Lode #4.
Yellowstone National Park is less than 2 hours southeast.
Close to the historic Missouri Mine, once an established gold producing mining claim.

This lode claim is unique as also has part of Leonard Creek running thru it to also add panning in the creek to your gold prospecting.
There is also a side road off of the claim road that leads to an open camping spot.
This claim is for those who want a more secluded claim off of the main South Meadow Creek Road.

The claim is located in the Tobacco Root Mountains having a history of gold production.
It is a good sign that there are other claims in this area being worked by experienced prospectors for years.
About 14.5 miles NW of the town of Ennis.
The h...The historic Missouri Mine once pulling in gold in the Montana Gold Rush is close by.

Ennis Lake is just north of the town of Ennis and can be enjoyed year round including winter ice skating and ice fishing.
South Meadow Creek Lake is just West, with the claim being in between the 2 lakes.
Located in a beautiful forest of pines and aspens.
This area has the feel of the Old West where the Cowboy Culture still lives on.

National Forests remained open at all times during the virus with a televised invitation by the Director for families to visit them as safe places for family recreation, making our mining claims some of the safest places for your family to enjoy and get away from all the nonsense.

A lode claim differs from our placer claims, as on a lode claim you can dig into the mountain side and can even go to the extent of building a mine shaft.
Having a lode claim is an advantage as you can dig into the claim with a mine shaft if you choose that is not allowed on placer claims.
A quartz/gold vein was discovered on the claim extending thru the claim.

Our lode claim has veins of valuable minerals including gold in veins (called lodes) cutting thru rocks. Quartz and gold are frequently found together and digging into the quartz vein is called chasing the vein.
A vein of quartz/gold runs South to North thru the middle of the claim.

Our claim is located in the Tobacco Root Mountains being well known for gold and gem discoveries.
The TV show, American Gold: The Legend of Bear Gulch, on the Fox Business Channel, takes place in these same mountains.
The TV series, Yellowstone with Kevin Costner, is filmed just West of this area.
The movie, The River Runs Thru it, with Brad Pitt, was filmed not too far away.
A great plus is having Yellowstone National Park less than a 2 hour drive South.
The Willow Creek Reservoir with boating and fishing is 15 miles away.

MADISON COUNTY: Down in Southwest Montana, sharing a tiny portion of its southern border with Idaho is Madison County. This mountainous part of Montana is wedged between Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks, and its residents maintain their local traditions that are inspired by the natural landscape, like fishing, ranching, and all things outdoors. 
The county seat is Virginia City, an interesting place split between the historic and the contemporary. Half of the town contains a vibrant, current-day population, while the other half is an abandoned mining town, preserved as a slice of history and a window into the lives of settlers from the mid-1800s. 
While Virginia City is probably the countys largest touristic draw, the nearby town of Ennis is a delightful stop for passers-through, and is host to many annual events. Though it doesnt immediately border Yellowstone National Park, Madison County, and more specifically Ennis, can make a great base from which to explore the park.

Gold prices had reached an all time high of $2000 per ounce.

Our claim here is 15 miles NW of the quaint mountain town of Ennis, and 54 miles SW of Bozeman, where we fly into, in Madison County, Montana.

SOUTHWEST MONTANA ROCKHOUNDING
Rockhounding is more than just a hobby; it is a lifestyle.
There's a reason Montana is known as the Treasure State and that Southwest Montana where our claims are located is especially rich for gold and precious gems.
Even today, you can tap into the euphoria of making a find in Montana.
A century and a half ago, these hills crawled with prospectors lured by rich gold strikes. 
Aquamarine, sapphires, garnets, amethyst, smoky quartz, clear quartz scepters, jaspers, topaz, and even diamnonds are also to be found in this part of Montana.
Because of such an availability of gems to be found, there are many Mineral and Gem Clubs throughout the state.
The geology of Montana had a history of volcanic activity which is largely responsible for the wide variety of interesting rocks and minerals to be found here.

MADISON COUNTY
Madison County has some of theworlds best fly-fishingand endless other outdoor activities. 
Close enough to Yellowstone National Park to visit, but far enough to be away from the crowds, this county has something for everybody during all seasons
throughout the year.
Amazing mountain views, spectacular trout fishing, and Cowboy Culture are just a few reasons to visit Madison Valley. 
During the summer months, there are endless options for outdoor activities like fishing, hiking, biking, and kayaking.
The Big Sky Ski resort is an hour and half SE with all the winter activities.
Nearby Willow Creek Reservoir is a fishing access site that also has camping. 
Fishing and boating may be enjoyed on the lake with a boat launch provided. 

MADISON VALLEY
The Madison Valley where our claims are located, is an area rooted in farming and ranching with blue ribbon rivers, majestic mountain ranges, abundant wildlife, and small towns with rural values.
Lewis and Clark crossed this scenic valley of majestic mountain ranges and the fabled Madison River in 1805, but not until 1864, shortly after gold was first discovered in the valley, did Madison County become part of Montana Territory.
Today, rural and community values keep ranching as the main way of life in the Madison Valley. Through conservation, the Madison Valley has sustained productive agricultural land, healthy grasslands, and abundant wildlife.

In addition to its old west charm, the Madison Valley has arguably the most superb fly-fishing waters in all the world and the Madison River may be our most glorious. Meriwether Lewis named the river in 1805 after James Madison, who was the US Secretary of State at the time. Starting in Yellowstone National Park, the river is 183 miles of perfectly moving riffles that are teaming with trout.

I am a retired teacher, and got into prospecting as a hobby with my family.
I am 72 and my wife 69, and we have gained the experience to select the best areas to locate claims.
We feel we are selling more than the gold and minerals on beautiful land.
You would be acquiring an experience that will give you a good feel for what the old time prospectors must have felt during the days of the original Montana Gold Rush.
A mining claim is an affordable way to enjoy the beauty of the land combined with the adventure of panning for gold.

Mining Claims as an investment: if you purchase a claim from us, at no charge, I would help you if you ever decided to sell in the future.
Mining Claims are a great investment, as claims go up in value over time, just as land does.

Gold and gems discovered in our own prospecting along with the beauty of the area, makes for awesome camping and prospecting.
Owning a mining claim is having access to a lifetime of great family fun and recreation, in a very beautiful, natural setting.

This is a 20.66 acre unpatented, gold and gem mining lode claim, the South Meadow Lode #4, in the Tobacco Root Mountains that are part of the Rocky Mountains, and in the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest. 
The claim is legally registered with the Montana Bureau of Land Management and the Madison County Recorder. 
You own the mineral rights, not sharing with others, on the 20.66 acres, and use your 20.66 acres recreationally for camping and prospecting in an awesome, beautiful area.

For the possibility of constructing any building you for others could live in, you need to file a Plan of Operation with the BLM for approval, showing you have developed a full-time operation performing diligent mining, though the BLM is reluctant to approve anything to live in. 
You do not need a plan, permission nor a permit to camp and prospect.
You do not need to be a full time prospector to file a Plan for a shed type structure.

With an approved BLM Plan of Operation, a building can be built on the land: any building that benefits and improves the claim, though you cannot live on a mining claim. 
As stated by the BLM, this can be the ""construction of a building, road, fence, or enclosure necessary for mining.""
Current usage, is what the BLM calls, Casual Use: panning, shovel, rock hammer, metal detector, creek powered sluice box, where no permission nor permit is needed to camp and prospect.

On our visits to the claim, we gathered in the mineral vein, approx. 1/4 of an ounce of gold, being worth about $450. As the BLM does not specify the amount of gold to be found to locate a claim other than a valuable mineral needs to be discovered, we use this amount for a 20.66 acre claim as a projection of good gold potential. Someone with more time may find more. 
Gold prices are over $1700/ounce. Though we could never guarantee what you will find, we did locate this claim in an historically rich area for gold prospecting.
Gold in 3 years has gone up $400 per ounce.
We also found some nice specimens of aquamarine and crystals on the claim.

You are allowed to post No Trespassing for Prospecting signs in and around the claim.
A mining claim owner may limit or restrict public recreational use of/or public access across claims or portions of claims that are actively used for prospecting, mining, or processing operations where public recreational use of a claim would endanger or materially interfere with legitimate mining pursuits.

Camp on your claim or area national forest campgrounds.
A claim owner does not need permission nor a permit to camp and prospect.
You can prospect as little or as much as you like.
Now that we have located the claim, you never have to declare to the BLM any gold or gems you find.

20.66 acres = parcel size of 600 ft. x 1500 ft.

Gold occurs in gravels in the metallic state and when so found has various physical characteristics. Gold is dense and heavy, it has a characteristic metallic color, and it is soft and easily malleable (it is easily formed by hammering). These are the characteristics used by prospectors to identify gold in the field.
Lode gold occurs on the claim usually in quartz veins derived from gossan formed by weathering, and oxidation of the gold, copper and iron rich veins. Gold is derived from the erosion of mineralized fault zones on the claim.

TERMS
To purchase our claim, the process would be, I would need your name(s) and mailing addresswhere I would scan and email you a signed contract, and which payment option you choose:

Total price of $3500, that can be paid in one full payment where your ownership is then transferred after receiving payment, 
or $3500, paying $1750 first month, and $1750 2nd month,
or $3500, paying $1500 first month, $1000 2nd month, and $1000 3rd month,
or $3500, paying $700 per month for 5 months.
A $99 deed processing fee is paid with final payment.

Owner financing, No credit check. No interest charged.
No down payment.
You can use the claim as yours while making monthly payments.
Ownership transfer after final monthly payment.
A signed contract will precede payment.   

After receiving your final payment, your ownership of the 20.66 acre claim will be legally recorded with the Montana Bureau of Land Management and the Madison County Recorder. The quit claim deed is the correct document to be recorded for a mining claim, as stated by the BLM. This is not a sharing with others of your 20.66 acre claim.

We live in Ohio. Our connection to Colorado is our daughter lives in Denver, though she is not involved with our claims. We visited her in September, then went to prospect and locate mining claims, as we have been doing for a number of years.

And just a note of encouragement for you if purchase:
My wife and I have located, prospected on, and sold mining claims in 
California, Colorado, Arizona, and now also in Montana, Wyoming, and South Dakota, for now over 25 years.
You can trust we will process your notarized deeds correctly and quickly.
In that mining claims are processed thru the Bureau of Land Management, a Federal Govt. agency, not following thru per our legally signed contract, would be a federal crime. I certainly will do what I say, and would never put myself nor my wife in any legal jeopardy.
Also, we have sold properties on 4 sites online for over 25 years:
Landsalelistings, Landwatch, LandsofAmerica, and LandandFarm.
Our continued good status on these sites is due to our always following thru, as just one time we would not, we would not be allowed to sell on these sites ever again.

COMMENTS FROM SATISFIED CLAIM BUYERS:

""Living in Colorado, the purchase of our mining claim from you has been great for family fun and recreation. We have camped overnight a number of times, and panned for gold in the creek. We were even able to find gold flakes on several of our attempts. Thank you so much!.""

""We purchased a 40 acre claim in California from Mr. Leu. Our claim is everything he told us it would be: Beautiful area, great for family camping outings, and, we have found gold while panning in the creek on our claim. We could not be happier with our purchase!""

""We purchased 2 mining claims from Michael Leu over the last 2 years, one in California, and one In Colorado. We have been to our claims on several occasions, and we could not be happier! They are exactly as described, and our camping on our claims and prospecting in the creek on each claim is the highlight of our vacations. You can trust Mr. Leu. If you are looking for a great time in the awesome beauty of the west, buying a mining claim from Mr. Leu will be a blessing.""",3500,20.66,N/A,".10.54., ",200,"https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112725969,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112725971,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112725972,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112725974,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112725976,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112725978,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112725980,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112725988,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112726028,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112725998,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112725995,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112726001,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112726006,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112726009,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112726014,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112726015,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112726016,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112726604,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112728634,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112726024,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112726017,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112726018,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112726019,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112726020,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112726021,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112726022,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112726023,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112726025,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112728330,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112726027,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112726029,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112726030,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112726031,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112728471,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112728606,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112728630,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112728631,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112728632,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112728633,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4112726026"

Hayfork Creek is located in the Trinity River Basin, where the creeks and rivers in this area are known historically as top gold producers.

This is a 20 acre unpatented, gold and gem mining placer claim, the Hayfork Creek #1, with the Hayfork Creek running thru it and is in Trinity County, California, in the beautiful mountain range known as the Trinity Alps, and in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. The claim is legally registered with the Bureau of Land Management out of Sacramento and the Trinity County Recorder. 
You own the mineral rights, not sharing with others, on the 20 acres, and use your 20 acres recreationally for camping and prospecting in an awesome, beautiful area.

We feel we are selling more than the gold and minerals on beautiful land.
You would be acquiring an experience that will give you a good feel for what the old time prospectors must have felt during the days of the original California Gold Rush.

I am a retired teacher, and got into prospecting as a hobby with my family.
I am 72 and my wife 69, and we have gained the experience to select the best areas to locate claims.

For the possibility of constructing any building you or others could live in, you need to file a Plan of Operation with the BLM for approval, showing you have developed a full-time operation performing diligent mining, though the BLM is reluctant to approve anything to live in,
You do not need a plan, permission nor a permit to camp and prospect.
You do not need to be a full time prospector to file a Plan for a shed type structure.
Now that we have located the claim, you never have to declare to the BLM any gold or gems you find. You can prospect as little or as much as you choose.

A mining claim is an affordable way to enjoy the beauty of the land combined with the adventure of panning for gold.

If within one year you are not satisfied with your claim, you can trade for another comparable claim, just paying the BLM and County transfer fees which will be about $125.

Claim buyer will also receive a new, free, Gold Panning Kit:
One 14 inch Gold Trap pan; One 10.5 inch Gravity Trap pan, One combination sifter/classifier with 7/16 of an inch exit holes, One Gold Guzzler snuffer bottle, One Tweezers/ Magnifying Glass combo tool.

Or camp in the area National Forest Campgrounds and private campgrounds.

Mining Claims as an investment: if you purchase a claim from us, at no charge, I would help you if you ever decided to sell in the future.
Mining Claims are a great investment, as claims go up in value over time, just as land does. This is one of the areas of the original California Gold Rush.
Owning a mining claim is having access to a lifetime of great family fun and recreation, in a very beautiful, natural setting.

For the possibility of constructing any building you or others could live in, you need to file a Plan of Operation with the BLM for approval, showing you have developed a full-time operation performing diligent mining, though the BLM is reluctant to approve anything to live in. 
You do not need a plan, permission nor a permit to camp and prospect.
You do not need to be a full time prospector to file a Plan for a shed type structure.
Now that we have located the claim, you never have to declare to the BLM any gold or gems you find. You can prospect as little or as much as you choose.

On our visits to the claim, we gathered in and around the creek, approx. 1/8 of an ounce of gold, being worth about $225. As the BLM does not specify the amount of gold or gems to be found to locate a claim other than gold or gems need to be discovered, we use this amount for a 20 acre claim as a projection of good gold potential. Someone with more time may find more. 
Gold prices were over $1900/ounce. Though we could never guarantee what you will find, we did locate this claim in an historical area for gold and gem prospecting.
Gold prices have gone up $400 in the past 3 years.
We also found some nice crystal specimens up the mountain ridge on the claim.

You are allowed to post No Trespassing for Prospecting signs around the claim.
A mining claim owner may limit or restrict public recreational use of/or public access across claims or portions of claims that are actively used for prospecting, mining, or processing operations where public recreational use of a claim would endanger or materially interfere with legitimate mining pursuits.

Have you ever visited a new place and felt wow about it? For many visitors, it happens at Hayfork. Hayfork may not be as popular as other cities in United States, but dont let that fool you. Hayfork is a smaller but beautiful upcoming tourist destination that is worth a visit. You will be surprised by some of the unique things to do and places you can explore at this hidden destination. You can definitely plan a few hours of a side trip here while traveling to Shasta Lake.

South of Weaverville on Highway 3 isthe town of Hayfork in the largest valley in Trinity County, named so because of the vast hay fields that grew along Hayfork Creek that winds through the valley. Today there are still a few large working ranches raising hay and cattle and other crops; and Hayfork is arguably the agricultural capital of the county. The Trinity County Fair is held in Hayfork in August of each year, bringing everyone ""home""to catch up with long-time friends and family. Visitors are often in awe of how ""old timey""the fair is with the focus on local agriculture, history, art, dried and canned goods, and local talent. Hayfork offers several grocery and convenience stores, coffee shops, and cafe's. Its an inviting little mountain town, home to about 2,500 residents with independent spirits that are also very community minded.

Trinity County has much to offer in outdoor recreation. It doesn't matter if your preference is on land or on water there is plenty of outdoor adventure here and waiting for you.
If you prefer land then the Trinity Alps Wilderness has more than enough to satisfy hikers, campers, bird watchers, nature and other outdoor land recreational enthusiasts. Miles of trails into the mountains provide memorable hiking and horseback riding, while abundant camping facilities provide a place to pitch camp for family outdoor fun.
If you prefer water, then there are the beautiful Trinity, Lewiston, and Ruth lakes, and the Trinity river and many streams provide all the water adventure that you can handle. White water rafting, boating, water sports, and trophy fishing all await you here!
Trinity Lake and Shasta Lake are nearby to enjoy boating, swimming, and fishing.

In the early 1850s, miners from around the world came to Weaverville after the discovery of gold at Sutters Mill in Coloma and the subsequent influx of people into northern California. Perason B. Reading mined the Trinity River near Douglas City at what is now called Reading Bar. News of Readings success drew miners to remote diggings.
In 1850, Sacramento newspapers publicized the gold diggings and more miners rushed into the area.
Trinity County is in California Gold Region 6. This region has a number of National Forests where prospecting, mining and panning is done.

Hayfork Creek running through the claim is a unique advantage for gold prospecting. It is a tributary of the gold rich Trinity River.
Gold always occurs in gravels in the metallic state and when so found has various physical characteristics. Gold is dense and heavy, it has a characteristic metallic color, and it is soft and easily malleable (it is easily formed by hammering). These are the characteristics used by prospectors to identify gold in the field.
Placer gold occurs on the claim as small grains derived from gossan formed by weathering, and oxidation of the gold, copper and iron rich veins. Gold also occurs as grains flakes and small nuggets derived from the erosion of mineralized fault zones on, and upstream from the claim.

We live in Ohio. Our connection to the West is our daughter lives in Denver, though she is not involved with our claims. We visited her in September, then went to prospect and locate mining claims in Colorado, then traveled to do the same in California, as we have been doing for a number of years. 

And just a note of encouragement for you if purchase:
My wife and I have located, prospected on, and sold mining claims in 
California, Colorado, & Arizona, going on now for now over 25 years.
You can trust we will process your notarized deeds correctly and quickly.
In that mining claims are processed thru the Bureau of Land Management, a 
Federal Govt. agency, not following thru per our legally signed contract, would be a federal crime. I certainly will do what I say, and would never put myself nor my wife
in any legal jeopardy.
Also, we have sold properties on 4 sites online for over 25 years:
Landsalelistings, Landwatch, LandsofAmerica, and LandandFarm.
Our continued good status on these sites is due to our always following thru, as just one time we would not, we would not be allowed to sell on these sites ever again.

Near the town of Pony, our claim is located in the Tobacco Root Mountains being well known for gold and gem discoveries.
The TV show, American Gold: The Legend of Bear Gulch, on the Fox Business Channel, takes place in these same mountains.
The TV series, Yellowstone with Kevin Costner, is filmed just West of this area.
The movie, The River Runs Thru it, with Brad Pitt, was filmed not too far away.
A great plus is having Yellowstone National Park a 2 hour drive South.
The Willow Creek Reservoir with boating and fishing is 15 miles away.

MADISON COUNTY: Down in Southwest Montana, sharing a tiny portion of its southern border with Idaho is Madison County. This mountainous part of Montana is wedged between Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks, and its residents maintain their local traditions that are inspired by the natural landscape, like fishing, ranching, and all things outdoors. 
The county seat is Virginia City, an interesting place split between the historic and the contemporary. Half of the town contains a vibrant, current-day population, while the other half is an abandoned mining town, preserved as a slice of history and a window into the lives of settlers from the mid-1800s. 
While Virginia City is probably the countys largest touristic draw, the nearby town of Ennis is a delightful stop for passers-through, and is host to many annual events. Though it doesnt immediately border Yellowstone National Park, Madison County, and more specifically Ennis, can make a great base from which to explore the park.

Gold prices had reached an all time high of $2000 per ounce.
It is also a good sign that there are other claims in this area being worked by experienced prospectors for years.

Our claim here is 8.4 miles SW of the quaint mountain town of Pony, and 54 miles West of Bozeman, where we fly into, in Madison County, Montana.
Beautifully forested area of pines and aspens.

To purchase our claim, the process would be, I would need your name(s) and mailing addresswhere I would scan and email you a signed contract, and which payment option you choose:

Total price of $3500, that can be paid in one full payment where your ownership is then transferred after receiving payment, 
or $3500, paying $1750 first month, and $1750 2nd month,
or $3500, paying $1500 first month, $1000 2nd month, and $1000 3rd month,
or $3500 paying $700 per month for 5 months.
A $99 deed processing fee is paid with final payment.

I am a retired teacher, and got into prospecting as a hobby with my family.
I am 72 and my wife 69, and we have gained the experience to select the best areas to locate claims.
We feel we are selling more than the gold and minerals on beautiful land.
You would be acquiring an experience that will give you a good feel for what the old time prospectors must have felt during the days of the original Montana Gold Rush.
A mining claim is an affordable way to enjoy the beauty of the land combined with the adventure of panning for gold.

Nearby Potosi Hot Springs is a rustic ranch resort along the South Willow Creeklocated in Southwestern Montana that offers fishing and hiking. Potosi boasts an outdoor hot springs pool, an indoor river rock soaking tub, and wood burning sauna. Accommodations are available.
Nearby Potosi Campground and Picnic Area is spread out over a very large space of land near the city of Pony. Drinking water is available during the Summer and Winter and there are also picnic tables, toilets, and parking.

MADISON VALLEY
The Madison Valley where our claims are located, is an area rooted in farming and ranching with blue ribbon rivers, majestic mountain ranges, abundant wildlife, and small towns with rural values.
Lewis and Clark crossed this scenic valley of majestic mountain ranges and the fabled Madison River in 1805, but not until 1864, shortly after gold was first discovered in the valley, did Madison County become part of Montana Territory.
Today, rural and community values keep ranching as the main way of life in the Madison Valley. Through conservation, the Madison Valley has sustained productive agricultural land, healthy grasslands, and abundant wildlife.

In addition to its old west charm, the Madison Valley has arguably the most superb fly-fishing waters in all the world and the Madison River may be our most glorious. Meriwether Lewis named the river in 1805 after James Madison, who was the US Secretary of State at the time. Starting in Yellowstone National Park, the river is 183 miles of perfectly moving riffles that are teaming with trout.

Ennis is the base camp of the Madison Valley, a colorful town filled with fly anglers and ranchers, 
Ennis sits on the banks of the Madison River and is surrounded by 3 mountain ranges.

SOUTHWEST MONTANA ROCKHOUNDING
Rockhounding is more than just a hobby; it is a lifestyle.
There's a reason Montana is known as the Treasure State and that Southwest Montana where our claims are located is especially rich for gold and precious gems.
Even today, you can tap into the euphoria of making a find in Montana.
A century and a half ago, these hills crawled with prospectors lured by rich gold strikes. 
Aquamarine, sapphires, garnets, amethyst, smoky quartz, clear quartz scepters, jaspers, topaz, and even diamnonds are also to be found in this part of Montana.
Because of such an availability of gems to be found, there are many Mineral and Gem Clubs throughout the state.
The geology of Montana had a history of volcanic activity which is largely responsible for the wide variety of interesting rocks and minerals to be found here.

MADISON COUNTY
Madison County has some of theworlds best fly-fishingand endless other outdoor activities. 
Close enough to Yellowstone National Park to visit, but far enough to be away from the crowds, this county has something for everybody during all seasons
throughout the year.
Amazing mountain views, spectacular trout fishing, and Cowboy Culture are just a few reasons to visit Madison Valley. 
During the summer months, there are endless options for outdoor activities like fishing, hiking, biking, and kayaking.
The Big Sky Ski resort is an hour and half SE with all the winter activities.
Nearby Willow Creek Reservoir is a fishing access site that also has camping. 
Fishing and boating may be enjoyed on the lake with a boat launch provided. 

TOBACCO ROOT MOUNTAINS
TheTobacco Root Mountainslie in the northernRocky Mountains, between theJeffersonandMadisonRivers in southwest Montana.
The highest peak isHollowtopat 10,604 feet (3,232m). The range contains 43 peaks rising to elevations greater than 10,000 feet (3048 m).
Much of the central part of the range is within theBeaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest. The range saw significant gold mining, especially during the 1880s to 1930s.

TOWN OF PONY
Pony, as a gateway into the Tobacco Root Mountains, may be categorized as a ghost town in much of todays literature about Montana, but it certainly has a lot of real people hanging around to be a ghost town.
Hidden in the Tobacco Root Range of the Montana Rockies is the historic gold mining town of Pony, Montana. It languishes in the beauty of the Deer Lodge National Forest at the base of Hollowtop Mountain. Less than one hundred families live in Pony today. 
It's hard to imagine that during the gold prospecting days, over 5,000 people lived here. In 1860-1870, settlers coming West for the gold rush found this beautiful spot.One was a man named Tecumseh Smith, nicknamed 'Pony' because of his small stature. Gold mining in Pony between 1870-1880 was profitable. Five million dollars in ore was taken out. The historic 'brick office', assay office, is still standing and part of the town's character. 
The Tobacco Root Mountains and surrounding areas are familiar grounds for elk, moose, deer, and antelope. And the bird hunting is great too: duck, geese, quail, turkey, pheasant, and more.
There are two trailheads, Albro Lake and Hollowtop Trail, at the end of the road of Pony. Many people hike to Hollowtop, where there is a ""sign in box"" for people that have made the approximate 6-hour hike to Hollowtop Mountain.
A number of historic buildings from Pony's boom era remain in the old town today. Major buildings are managed, voluntarily, by The Pony Homecoming Club, a non-profit organization that maintains the town's public spaces.
ENNIS LAKE
Located SE of our claims, the lake is 5000 acres and is just north of the town of Ennis.
Its nearness toYellowstone National Parkmakes Ennis Lake and its surrounding region a great home base from which to navigate a southwesternMontana vacation.
The depth of the 2.5-mile long lake ranges somewhere between 8 and 20 feet, and the water is warm and ideal for a variety of water sports like windsurfing.
Ennis Lake is for all seasons and draws in water-loving recreation enthusiasts, and in winter it is especially popular for ice skating and ice fishing.

BOZEMAN
Bozeman is called the most livable place for good reason. 
Enjoy world-renowned fly fishing, dramatic mountains for hiking, mountain biking, rock climbing, skiing, hunting, and backcountry exploring, Yellowstone National Park, and impressive wildlife. 
When you are ready for a more city experience, dive into Bozemans thriving arts and culture communities, ranging from main street festivals, farmers markets, cultural centers and museums to symphonies, theaters, and art galleries.

If within one year you are not satisfied with your claim, you can trade for another comparable claim, just paying the BLM and County transfer fees which will be about $125.

Claim buyer will also receive a new, free, Gold Panning Kit:
One 14 inch Gold Trap pan; One 10.5 inch Gravity Trap pan, One combination sifter/classifier with 7/16 of an inch exit holes, One Gold Guzzler snuffer bottle, One Tweezers/ Magnifying Glass combo tool.

Mining Claims as an investment: if you purchase a claim from us, at no charge, I would help you if you ever decided to sell in the future.
Mining Claims are a great investment, as claims go up in value over time, just as land does.

Gold and gems discovered in our own prospecting along with the beauty of the area, makes for awesome camping and prospecting.
Owning a mining claim is having access to a lifetime of great family fun and recreation, in a very beautiful, natural setting.

This is a 20 acre unpatented, gold mining placer claim, the Willow Creek #5, with beautiful Willow Creek running all the way thru the claim, in the Tobacco Root Mountains that are part of the Rocky Mountains, and in the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest. 
The claim is legally registered with the Montana Bureau of Land Management and the Madison County Recorder. 
You own the mineral rights, not sharing with others, on the 20 acres, and use your 20 acres recreationally for camping and prospecting in an awesome, beautiful area.

For the possibility of constructing any building you for others could live in, you need to file a Plan of Operation with the BLM for approval, showing you have developed a full-time operation performing diligent mining, though the BLM is reluctant to approve anything to live in. 
You do not need a plan, permission nor a permit to camp and prospect.
You do not need to be a full time prospector to file a Plan for a shed type structure.

With an approved BLM Plan of Operation, a building can be built on the land: any building that benefits and improves the claim, though you cannot live on a mining claim. 
As stated by the BLM, this can be the ""construction of a building, road, fence, or enclosure necessary for mining.""
Current usage, is what the BLM calls, Casual Use: panning, shovel, rock hammer, metal detector, creek powered sluice box, where no permission nor permit is needed to camp and prospect.

On our visits to the claim, we gathered in and around the creek, approx. 1/8 of an ounce of gold, being worth about $250. As the BLM does not specify the amount of gold to be found to locate a claim other than gold needs to be discovered, we use this amount for a 20 acre claim as a projection of good gold potential. Someone with more time may find more. 
Gold prices were over $1700/ounce. Though we could never guarantee what you will find, we did locate this claim in an historically rich area for gold prospecting.
Gold in 3 years has gone up $400 per ounce.
We also found some nice specimens of aquamarine and crystals on the claim.

You are allowed to post No Trespassing for Prospecting signs in and around the claim.
A mining claim owner may limit or restrict public recreational use of/or public access across claims or portions of claims that are actively used for prospecting, mining, or processing operations where public recreational use of a claim would endanger or materially interfere with legitimate mining pursuits.

_____________________________ 

Your ownership is legally conveyed via a Quit Claim deed, and legally recorded with the Montana BLM and the Madison County Recorder. A Quit Claim deed is the required legal document per the BLM.

The creek on the claim is a unique advantage for gold prospecting.
Gold always occurs in gravels in the metallic state and when so found has various physical characteristics. Gold is dense and heavy, it has a characteristic metallic color, and it is soft and easily malleable (it is easily formed by hammering). These are the characteristics used by prospectors to identify gold in the field.
Placer gold occurs on the claim as small grains derived from gossan formed by weathering, and oxidation of the gold, copper and iron rich veins. Gold also occurs as grains flakes and small nuggets derived from the erosion of mineralized fault zones on, and upstream from the claim.

TERMS
To purchase our claim, the process would be, I would need your name(s) and mailing addresswhere I would scan and email you a signed contract, and which payment option you choose:

Total price of $3500, that can be paid in one full payment where your ownership is then transferred after receiving payment, 
or $3500, paying $1750 first month, and $1750 2nd month,
or $3500, paying $1500 first month, $1000 2nd month, and $1000 3rd month,
or $3500 paying $700 per month for 5 months.
A $99 deed processing fee is paid with final payment.   

After receiving your final payment, your ownership of the 20 acre claim will be legally recorded with the Montana Bureau of Land Management and the Madison County Recorder. The quit claim deed is the correct document to be recorded for a mining claim, as stated by the BLM. 
This is not a sharing with others of your 20 acre claim.

We live in Ohio. Our connection to the West is our daughter lives in Denver, though she is not involved with our claims. We visited her in September, then went to prospect and locate mining claims in other states, including Montana, Wyoming, and South Dakota, as we have been doing for a number of years.

And just a note of encouragement for you if purchase:
My wife and I have located, prospected on, and sold mining claims in California, Colorado, Arizona, and now also Montana, Wyoming, and South Dakota, for now over 25 years.
You can trust we will process your notarized deeds correctly and quickly.
In that mining claims are processed thru the Bureau of Land Management, a Federal Govt. agency, not following thru per our legally signed contract, would be a federal crime. I certainly will do what I say, and would never put myself nor my wife in any legal jeopardy.
Also, we have sold properties on 4 sites online for over 25 years:
Landsalelistings, Landwatch, LandsofAmerica, and LandandFarm.
Our continued good status on these sites is due to our always following thru, as just one time we would not, we would not be allowed to sell on these sites ever again.

COMMENTS FROM SATISFIED CLAIM BUYERS:

""Living in Colorado, the purchase of our mining claim from you has been great for family fun and recreation. We have camped overnight a number of times, and panned for gold in the creek. We were even able to find gold flakes on several of our attempts. Thank you so much!.""

""We purchased a 40 acre claim in California from Mr. Leu. Our claim is everything he told us it would be: Beautiful area, great for family camping outings, and, we have found gold while panning in the creek on our claim. We could not be happier with our purchase!""

""We purchased 2 mining claims from Michael Leu over the last 2 years, one in California, and one In Colorado. We have been to our claims on several occasions, and we could not be happier! They are exactly as described, and our camping on our claims and prospecting in the creek on each claim is the highlight of our vacations. You can trust Mr. Leu. If you are looking for a great time in the awesome beauty of the west, buying a mining claim from Mr. Leu will be a blessing.""",3500,20,N/A,".54., ",200,"https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4118745362,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111160040,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111158996,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111159422,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111160249,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111160354,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111169036,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4118745365,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111166605,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111162318,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111161629,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111168976,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111163337,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111163765,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111165566,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111169015,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111164332,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111166394,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111168820,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111168822,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111168833,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111168842,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111168851,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111168950,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111168952,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111168954,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111168956,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4118745372,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111168962,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111168961,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111168963,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111168974,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111168978,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111168979,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111168998,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111169000,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111169003,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111169004,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111169028,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111169029,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111169032,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111169033,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4111169038"

The subdivision has all roads in place and every lot is accessible. You can build up to a 200 square foot structure with a median roof height of no more than 10' without a building permit. There are several cabins and storage structures already built in the area. We saw a freshly constructed storage/weather bunker being constructed last time we visited. 

The primary attractions in the area are fishing, camping, hunting, hiking, and any other outdoor activity you can think of. This property is situated between Deadhorse and Campbell lakes, offering wonderful fishing opportunities. Scenic vistas of the lakes and the surrounding country are found throughout this system, but particularly from the heights of Campbell and Dead Horse Rims. On a clear day the distant views from these lofty viewpoints are spectacular and limited only by the curvature of the Earth.

Interstate 80 traverses Elko County, making it a convenient destination. With a population of around 25,000, the city has all the amenities one could need including restaurants, hotels, and shopping. This area of Nevada also has many outdoor activities within a short drive. The mountains, lakes, and rivers around Elko offer numerous recreational opportunities. Among the wide open spaces can be found spectacular mountain ranges and canyons suitable for picnicking, hiking or more serious outdoor adventures.  Elko county is the sixth largest county in the United States, consisting of 17,181 square miles, as big as five of the New England states plus the District of Columbia.

With two spectacular wilderness areas and thousands of square miles of open space, Elko County offers limitless outdoor recreation opportunities  including hiking, mountain biking, rock climbing, horseback riding, camping, golf, wildlife viewing, backpacking, boating, fishing and ATVing. The Ruby Mountains, which have been described as Nevadas Alps, provide the most breathtaking scenery. Hiking trails are suitable for all skill levels, from the family-friendly Nature Trail to the 40-mile Ruby Crest Trail. Trails for hikers and horseback riders lead over Liberty Pass into the Ruby Wilderness, with its clear alpine lakes and panoramic views.

Three-quarters of Elko County is public land, which gives wildlife such as mule deer, antelope, mountain goats and bighorn sheep plenty of room to roam. The hunting season offers tag-holders a shot at big game, as well as the unusual birds such as chukar and Hungarian partridge, Sagehen, Quail, Dove and the illusive Himalayan Snowcock.

On the east side of the Mesa, Sanchez Reservoir, completed in 1913, was the fifth largest earth and stone dam in the world at that time. Today it is a state wildlife area with a 4-mile long, 2,000 acre lake that provides excellent fishing. 

There is electricity along several main roads, including Wild Horse Drive, where there are power poles.

Rockhounding in Colorado 
Starting with the rich gold and silver deposits which were the starting point of so many Colorado towns, the Centennial State, with over 770 types of minerals to be found, is second only to California in the number of different gems and minerals statewide.
Colorado is also host to a dizzying array of rocks and minerals. Some of the higher profile include dinosaur fossils.
Colorado can certainly be considered a rockhound and gem hunters dream. 
The vast mountains of national forests gives one a newfound sense of exploration and discovery.

Eagle County has a rich history associated with all that makes the West the West. Native American culture, mining, agriculture, ranching and recreation all have played important roles in the countys past.   
In 1865 the immortal Lincoln sent a special message to the miners of the West. He said: ""Tell the miners for me, I shall promote their interests to the best of my ability, because their prosperity is the prosperity of the nation, and we shall prove in a very few years that we are indeed the treasury of the world. How substantially this prophecy has been fulfilled is demonstrated in the ever increasing output in gold, silver and other metals in the great West, of which Colorado is the greatest state.
Eagle county has done her share to swell the annual mineral production of the state since 1879, and it may be said the growth of the county was based on the mining industry.
Gold prices reached an all time high of $2000 per ounce:

I am a retired teacher, and got into prospecting as a hobby with my family.
I am 72 and my wife 69, and we have gained the experience to select the best areas to locate claims.

We feel we are selling more than the gold and minerals on beautiful land.
You would be acquiring an experience that will give you a good feel for what the old time prospectors must have felt during the days of the original Colorado Gold Rush.

A mining claim is an affordable way to enjoy the beauty of the land combined with the adventure of panning for gold.

If within one year you are not satisfied with your claim, you can trade for another comparable claim, just paying the BLM and County transfer fees which will be about $125.

Claim buyer will also receive a new, free, Gold Panning Kit:
One 14 inch Gold Trap pan; One 10.5 inch Gravity Trap pan, One combination sifter/classifier with 7/16 of an inch exit holes, One Gold Guzzler snuffer bottle, One Tweezers/ Magnifying Glass combo tool.

Mining Claims as an investment: if you purchase a claim from us, at no charge, I would help you if you ever decided to sell in the future.
Mining Claims are a great investment, as claims go up in value over time, just as land does.

Gold and gems discovered in our own prospecting along with the beauty of the area, makes for awesome camping and prospecting.

Owning a mining claim is having access to a lifetime of great family fun and recreation, in a very beautiful, natural setting.

This is a 20 acre unpatented, gold mining placer claim, the Pearl Creek #1 claim, with beautiful Pearl Creek running all the way thru the claim, in the Rocky Mountains, and the White River National Forest. 
The claim is legally registered with the Bureau of Land Management out of Lakewood, CO and Eagle County. You own the mineral rights, not sharing with others, on the 20 acres, and use your 20 acres recreationally for camping and prospecting in an awesome, beautiful area.

For the possibility of constructing any building you for others could live in, you need to file a Plan of Operation with the BLM for approval, showing you have developed a full-time operation performing diligent mining, though the BLM is reluctant to approve anything to live in. 
You do not need a plan, permission nor a permit to camp and prospect.
You do not need to be a full time prospector to file a Plan for a shed type structure.

With an approved BLM Plan of Operation, a building can be built on the land: any building that benefits and improves the claim, though you cannot live on a mining claim. 
As stated by the BLM, this can be the ""construction of a building, road, fence, or enclosure necessary for mining.""
Current usage, is what the BLM calls, Casual Use: panning, shovel, rock hammer, metal detector, creek powered sluice box, where no permission nor permit is needed to camp and prospect.

On our visits to the claim, we gathered in and around the creek, approx. 1/8 of an ounce of gold, being worth about $225. As the BLM does not specify the amount of gold to be found to locate a claim other than gold needs to be discovered, we use this amount for a 20 acre claim as a projection of good gold potential. Someone with more time may find more. Gold prices are over $1600/ounce. Though we could never guarantee what you will find, we did locate this claim in an historically rich area for gold prospecting.
Gold in 3 years has gone up $400 per ounce.

You are allowed to post No Trespassing for Prospecting signs in and around the claim.
A mining claim owner may limit or restrict public recreational use of/or public access across claims or portions of claims that are actively used for prospecting, mining, or processing operations where public recreational use of a claim would endanger or materially interfere with legitimate mining pursuits.

Camp on your claim or nearby national forest campgrounds.
A claim owner does not need permission nor a permit to camp and prospect.
You can prospect as little or as much as you like.
Now that we have located the claims, you never have to declare to the BLM any gold or gems you find.

Eagle County, named for the Eagle River that runs thru the town of Eagle, is rich with trails, byways, protected forests and wilderness areas. Much of Eagle County is comprised of theWhite River National Forest. The Bureau of Land Management oversees much of the remainder of the land.
When visiting Eagle County, its easy to get caught up in the resort mindset However, if you want a change of scenery, find that small town, Americana setting in Eagle Countys small towns. The welcoming, down to earth vibe seems more like something from a storybook than a travel brochure, and the things to do in Eagle County embrace this. 
People go out for walks about town and greet passersby. If you take a break between your days activities, do as the locals do and hang out in a coffee shop. Like most of Eagle County, outdoor activities reign supreme year round.
During the summer, things to do often include hiking, golfing, fishing and visiting parks. Spice things up a bit with a hot air balloon trip or paleontological project at a fossil dig site. When winter sets in, trade your hiking boots for skis. If youd rather skate, then head to a town park that the town floods every winter to create a picture perfect ice skating rink. 
For indoor Eagle County things to do, try touring a brewery, winery or distillery, practice your craft at a local art studio or round up your crew for a night of bowling.

Eagle County has the feeling of the Old West and is away from all the crowds, noise, and traffic jams of large cities.

This claim in this wonderful area, has direct legal road access on a good Forest Service Road, with an area for camping, and gold and gems discovered in surface prospecting.

The creek on the claim is a unique advantage for gold prospecting.
Gold always occurs in gravels in the metallic state and when so found has various physical characteristics. Gold is dense and heavy, it has a characteristic metallic color, and it is soft and easily malleable (it is easily formed by hammering). These are the characteristics used by prospectors to identify gold in the field.
Placer gold occurs on the claim as small grains derived from gossan formed by weathering, and oxidation of the gold, copper and iron rich veins. Gold also occurs as grains flakes and small nuggets derived from the erosion of mineralized fault zones on, and upstream from the claim.

TERMS
To purchase our claim, the process would be, I would need your name(s) and mailing addresswhere I would scan and email you a signed contract, and which payment option you choose:

Total price of $3500, that can be paid in one full payment where your ownership is then transferred after receiving payment, 
or $3500, paying $1750 first month, and $1750 2nd month,
or $3500, paying $1500 first month, $1000 2nd month, and $1000 3rd month,
or $3500, paying $700 per month for 5 months.
A $99 deed processing fee is paid with final payment.

Owner financing, No credit check. No interest charged.
No down payment.
You can use the claim as yours while making monthly payments.
Ownership transfer after final monthly payment.
A signed contract will precede payment.   

After receiving your final payment, your ownership of the 20 acre claim will be legally recorded with the local Bureau of Land Management and Eagle County. The quit claim deed is the correct document to be recorded for a mining claim, as stated by the BLM. This is not a sharing with others of your 20 acre claim.

We live in Ohio. Our connection to Colorado is our daughter lives in Denver, though she is not involved with our claims. We visited her in September, then went to prospect and locate mining claims, as we have been doing for a number of years.

And just a note of encouragement for you if purchase:
My wife and I have located, prospected on, and sold mining claims in 
California, Colorado, Arizona, and now also Montana, Wyoming, and South Dakota, for now over 25 years.
You can trust we will process your notarized deeds correctly and quickly.
In that mining claims are processed thru the Bureau of Land Management, a Federal Govt. agency, not following thru per our legally signed contract, would be a federal crime. I certainly will do what I say, and would never put myself nor my wife in any legal jeopardy.
Also, we have sold properties on 4 sites online for over 25 years:
Landsalelistings, Landwatch, LandsofAmerica, and LandandFarm.
Our continued good status on these sites is due to our always following thru, as just one time we would not, we would not be allowed to sell on these sites ever again.

COMMENTS FROM SATISFIED CLAIM BUYERS:

""Living in Colorado, the purchase of our mining claim from you has been great for family fun and recreation. We have camped overnight a number of times, and panned for gold in the creek. We were even able to find gold flakes on several of our attempts. Thank you so much!.""

""We purchased a 40 acre claim in California from Mr. Leu. Our claim is everything he told us it would be: Beautiful area, great for family camping outings, and, we have found gold while panning in the creek on our claim. We could not be happier with our purchase!""

""We purchased 2 mining claims from Michael Leu over the last 2 years, one in California, and one In Colorado. We have been to our claims on several occasions, and we could not be happier! They are exactly as described, and our camping on our claims and prospecting in the creek on each claim is the highlight of our vacations. You can trust Mr. Leu. If you are looking for a great time in the awesome beauty of the west, buying a mining claim from Mr. Leu will be a blessing.""",3500,20,N/A,".8.5.120., ",200,"https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095048270,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095048272,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095048265,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095048266,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4113502194,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095048325,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095048283,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095048280,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095048282,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095436729,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095048310,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095048315,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095048318,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4116990963,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095048320,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095048329,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095048336,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095048335,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095048342,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095048330,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095048332,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095048340,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095048341,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095048345,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095048350,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095064846,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4095048344"

Situated on the Humboldt River halfway between Reno and Salt Lake City. Interstate 80 traverses Elko County, making it a convenient destination. With a population of around 25,000, the city has all the amenities one could need including restaurants, hotels, and shopping. This area of Nevada also has many outdoor activities within a short drive. The mountains, lakes, and rivers around Elko offer numerous recreational opportunities. Among the wide-open spaces can be found spectacular mountain ranges and canyons suitable for picnicking, hiking or more serious outdoor adventures.  Elko county is the sixth largest county in the United States, consisting of 17,181 square miles, as big as five of the New England states plus the District of Columbia.

With two spectacular wilderness areas and thousands of square miles of open space, Elko County offers limitless outdoor recreation opportunities  including hiking, mountain biking, rock climbing, horseback riding, camping, golf, wildlife viewing, backpacking, boating, fishing and ATVing. The Ruby Mountains, which have been described as Nevadas Alps, provide the most breathtaking scenery. Hiking trails are suitable for all skill levels, from the family-friendly Nature Trail to the 40-mile Ruby Crest Trail. Trails for hikers and horseback riders lead over Liberty Pass into the Ruby Wilderness, with its clear alpine lakes and panoramic views.

Three-quarters of Elko County is public land, which gives wildlife such as mule deer, antelope, mountain goats and bighorn sheep plenty of room to roam. The hunting season offers tag-holders a shot at big game, as well as the unusual birds such as chukar and Hungarian partridge, Sagehen, Quail, Dove and the illusive Himalayan Snowcock.

The best-kept secret in north Arkansas is Horseshoe Bend. Nestled in the Ozark Mountains on the Strawberry River, this quaint town is the perfect place to find rest, relaxation, and recreation.

On Crown Lake, water lovers can participate in a variety of activities, including swimming, kayaking, paddle boarding, water skiing, and tubing. Crown Lake is best known for good fishing, but it is not the only sought-after fishing hole in the area. Besides Crown Lake and the Strawberry River, fishing enthusiasts can also visit one of the smaller fishing lakes  Diamond, Pioneer, and North.
 
There are plenty of activities for young and old alike! Golfers have their choice between two par 3, 18-hole golf courses. Citizens and guests can also bowl, pitch horseshoes, and play miniature golf. The town has several stores, a library, three resorts, a community theater, a spa, and several restaurants.
 
The citizens of Horseshoe Bend take pride in the community spirit and the ability to offer a memorable experience for all who come to visit. The Music in the Mountains show occurs every third Saturday of the month, and during summer, the Farmers Market occurs every Wednesday. Every year, the town celebrates Dogwood Days on the second Saturday of May, and Independence Day is celebrated every 4th of July with a parade and fireworks. The annual Christmas parade occurs on the first Saturday in December. There are many more events that happen throughout the year, thanks to the numerous civic groups which are active in Horseshoe Bend. All of these events embrace the unique Ozark culture of small-town pride and fellowship.
 
The largest town in Izard County with 2,180 residents, Horseshoe Bend is accessible to the state's most scenic highways. The town is centrally located and just a 3-hour drive to Little Rock, Memphis, and Springfield. With its gorgeous views, slower pace of life, and laid-back charm, Horseshoe Bend is the perfect place to stay a week or a lifetime.

Interstate 80 traverses Elko County, making it a convenient destination. With a population of around 25,000, the city has all the amenities one could need including restaurants, hotels, and shopping. This area of Nevada also has many outdoor activities within a short drive. The mountains, lakes, and rivers around Elko offer numerous recreational opportunities. Among the wide-open spaces can be found spectacular mountain ranges and canyons suitable for picnicking, hiking or more serious outdoor adventures.  Elko County is the fourth largest county in the United States, consisting of 17,181 square miles, as big as five of the New England states plus the District of Columbia.

With two spectacular wilderness areas and thousands of square miles of open space, Elko County offers limitless outdoor recreation opportunities  including hiking, mountain biking, rock climbing, horseback riding, camping, golf, wildlife viewing, backpacking, boating, fishing and ATVing. The Ruby Mountains, which have been described as Nevadas Alps, provide the most breathtaking scenery. Hiking trails are suitable for all skill levels, from the family-friendly Nature Trail to the 40-mile Ruby Crest Trail. Trails for hikers and horseback riders lead over Liberty Pass into the Ruby Wilderness, with its clear alpine lakes and panoramic views.

Three-quarters of Elko County is public land, which gives wildlife such as mule deer, antelope, mountain goats and bighorn sheep plenty of room to roam. The hunting season offers tag-holders a shot at big game, as well as the unusual birds such as chukar and Hungarian partridge, Sagehen, Quail, Dove and the illusive Himalayan Snowcock.

Everyone says good things about their land. 

.

BUT NOT ME!

I will simply share with you the facts. 

You'll decide whether you like it or not.

.

Sounds fair?

Great. 

.

There are three main things you should know about this land. 

.

First,

It is a buildable lot, 

and there aren't many buildable lots left in this area. 

The minimum requirement to build is only 600 sqft. 

This is great, because one day, when you'll be ready to build on it,

you won't have to spend a lot of money. 

.

Second, 

You can camp on this lot

all year long but in the wintertime.

You can camp from March until November. 

.

And third,

You can even Airbnb it.

So now, not only that the land may appreciate in value,

you can also turn your asset into a money-making machine

that generates cash flow for you and your family. 

.

HOW COOL IS THAT RIGHT?

Right.

.

Besides that, 

No need t...No need to say that area is full of attractions:

.

Aside from being 2 miles from Ozark's Lake, 

You will be close to many other attractions including: 

The Truman Reservoir - 18 miles away

Drake Harbor - 18.9 Miles away

The Brush Creek State Wild Life - 23 Miles away.

And many more...


.
If you want to take a quick ride to the nearest city, 

Warsaw is only 18 miles away. 

.

Like many others who bought land in this area,

you can too. 

.

IN FACT,

you can finance it at these convenient terms:

Down payment: $150

Doc fee: $250

Term: 58 months.

Monthly payment: $150.

Monthly note fee: $10

Eagle Bay community fee + Property tax: $29/month
.
Or?
.
Get it at a substantial cash discount for $5950

That is all. 

Seriously!

.

If it burns inside of you,

you can secure this lot now.

Call me at 904-552-9044 and pay the down payment + doc fee.

.

Once you'll do that,

you will get a receipt in your email

and I will contact you for further details.


.
And if you have more questions and want to talk,

feel free to leave me a message here,

text or call me at (904) 552-9044.

I will be happy to chat.

Yours

Nate

.

P.S

I'm glad to give you a 90 day money back guarantee.

It means that you can get all your monthly payment back 

in the first 90 days of your purchase.

No questions asked. 

I will also put it in writing on the agreement.


.
SO...

If you feel ready, and want to grab this lot today,

Simply call me at 904-552-9044

Hope to hear from you soon,",5950,0.48,N/A,"38.288654999999999, -93.176365000000004",29,"https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099600259,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4093302582,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4093302585,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4093302584,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4093302586,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4093302587,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4093302590,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4093302593,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4093302591,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4093302592,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4093302588,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4093302589,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4093302595,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4099600260,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4093302594,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4093302583"

This claim is in a very mineralized area, and is great for rock hounds, metal detecting, relic hunting, and dry-washing. It is one of the largest areas of historic gold mining discoveries. 
Great views of the surrounding mountains, buttes, and rock formations.

Our claim is in the Tonto National Forest, which embraces almost 3 million acres of rugged and spectacularly beautiful country, ranging from Saguaro cactus-studded desert to pine-forested mountains beneath the Mogollon Rim. This variety in vegetation and range in altitude (from 1,300 to 7,900 feet) offers outstanding recreational opportunities throughout the year, whether its lake beaches or cool pine forest. Hikers, backpackers, wildlife observers and photographers will find many recreation opportunities here. The area's Juniper Canyon furnishes the solitude and secluded experience treasured by many wilderness visitors. 

A transfer of ownership is a sale of legal, exclusive ownership of a mining claim site. To be a legally recorded claim, gold had to be found on the claim, which was completed by us, as we are the original claim locators. 

Your ownership is legally conveyed via a Quit Claim deed, and legally recorded with the BLM and Gila County. A Quit Claim deed is the required legal document per the BLM. 
Each year, on or before September 1st, you need to file a simple form with the Bureau of Land Management, along with $165. We will supply this form to you. 
Fee is paid, not due again until Sept. 1, 2023.
There are no taxes on mining claims in Arizona. 
You must be a current US citizen with a US address to own a mining claim in the US. 
An unpatented mining claim is a specific parcel of federal land, valuable for a specific mineral deposit or deposits. It is a parcel for which an individual has asserted a legal right of possession and the right to develop and extract a discovered, valuable, mineral deposit. Mining claims are real property that you can buy, sell, or inherit. After proving the existence of valuable minerals on the land, the claim is legally recorded with the Bureau of Land Management, and Gila county. 

Gold always occurs in gravels in the metallic state and when so found has various physical characteristics. Gold is dense and heavy, it has a characteristic metallic color, and it is soft and easily malleable (it is easily formed by hammering). These are the characteristics used by prospectors to identify gold in the field. Placer gold occurs on the claim as small grains derived from gossan formed by weathering, and oxidation of the gold, copper and iron rich veins. Gold also occurs as grains flakes and small nuggets derived from the erosion of mineralized fault zones. 

The Federal Government owns the land. 
You are purchasing the mineral rights. 
You can legally camp for free, with camper and RV on the whole 20 acres. 
A claim owner does not need permission nor a permit to camp and prospect.
Prospect, explore, and camp on the whole 20 acres. 
This is not a sharing of a mining claim: Is your exclusive ownership.

TERMS:
To purchase our claim, the process would be, I would need your name(s) and mailing address where I would scan and email you a signed contract, and which payment option you choose:

Total price of $3500, that can be paid in one full payment where your ownership is then transferred after receiving payment, 
or $3500, paying $1750 first month, and $1750 2nd month,
or $3500, paying $1500 first month, $1000 2nd month, and $1000 3rd month,
or $4000, paying $500 per month for 8 months.
A $99 deed processing fee is paid with final payment.

Owner financing, No credit check. No interest charged
No down payment.
You can use the claim as yours while making monthly payments.
Ownership transfer after final monthly payment.
A signed contract will precede payment.

After receiving your final monthly payment, I will process 2 notarized deeds, transferring my claim ownership over to you, with both the BLM and Gila county. 

We live in Ohio. Our connection to the West is our daughter lives in Denver, though she is not involved with our claims. We visited her in September, then went to prospect and locate mining claims in Colorado, then traveled to do the same in California, as we have been doing for a number of years. 

And just a note of encouragement for you if purchase:
My wife and I have located, prospected on, and sold mining claims in 
California, Colorado, & Arizona, going on now for now over 25 years.
You can trust we will process your notarized deeds correctly and quickly.
In that mining claims are processed thru the Bureau of Land Management, a 
Federal Govt. agency, not following thru per our legally signed contract, would be a federal crime. I certainly will do what I say, and would never put myself nor my wife
in any legal jeopardy.
Also, we have sold properties on 4 sites online for over 25 years:
Landsalelistings, Landwatch, LandsofAmerica, and LandandFarm.
Our continued good status on these sites is due to our always following thru, as just one time we would not, we would not be allowed to sell on these sites ever again.

COMMENTS FROM SATISFIED CLAIM BUYERS:

""We live in Arizona and purchased a mining claim from Mr. Leu.
The claim is everything as advertised.  The Superstition Mountains make for awesome views. We have camped on our claim a number of times and have found gold in the wash on our claim. We are very happy with our purchase.

Living in another state, we were a little skeptical on buying a mining claim in Arizona. But our personal experience with Mr. Leu has been a family blessing.
Our camping and prospecting on our claim has brought our family closer together.
We were so pleased, we bought a claim in Colorado from Mr. Leu, and are looking to buy one also in California as we look to plan family vacations around our claims. 

Thanks Michael. We took our girls to the campsite area closest to the claim last weekend.

Interstate 80 traverses Elko County, making it a convenient destination. With a population of around 25,000, the city has all the amenities one could need including restaurants, hotels, and shopping. This area of Nevada also has many outdoor activities within a short drive. The mountains, lakes, and rivers around Elko offer numerous recreational opportunities. Among the wide-open spaces can be found spectacular mountain ranges and canyons suitable for picnicking, hiking or more serious outdoor adventures.  Elko County is the fourth largest county in the United States, consisting of 17,181 square miles, as big as five of the New England states plus the District of Columbia.

With two spectacular wilderness areas and thousands of square miles of open space, Elko County offers limitless outdoor recreation opportunities  including hiking, mountain biking, rock climbing, horseback riding, camping, golf, wildlife viewing, backpacking, boating, fishing and ATVing. The Ruby Mountains, which have been described as Nevadas Alps, provide the most breathtaking scenery. Hiking trails are suitable for all skill levels, from the family-friendly Nature Trail to the 40-mile Ruby Crest Trail. Trails for hikers and horseback riders lead over Liberty Pass into the Ruby Wilderness, with its clear alpine lakes and panoramic views.

Three-quarters of Elko County is public land, which gives wildlife such as mule deer, antelope, mountain goats and bighorn sheep plenty of room to roam. The hunting season offers tag-holders a shot at big game, as well as the unusual birds such as chukar and Hungarian partridge, Sagehen, Quail, Dove and the illusive Himalayan Snowcock.

Maximums are mostly in the 90s, rarely rising to 100 degrees or higher. Nights are comfortably cool. Maximum temperatures usually occur during June, while in July and August frequent afternoon thunderstorms tend to hold down daytime temperatures.

This property is located in Christmas Valley, really close to the Lake and just a few minutes away from shops, stores, gas, golf course and other amenities at your convenience.
The town of Christmas Valley (population 1,313) is little more than a few small restaurants, a pair of motels and a gas station. But spend a few days driving the bumpy gravel roads that lead off in all directions, and you'll find a pocket of fascinating natural attractions: cracks, craters, sand dunes and volcanic glass.
Some are well-established recreation sites with amenities nearby, but most remain relatively obscure. These are not places you stumble upon, but places you actively seek out. Discover the growing Christmas Valley.

The high desert climate in the valley areas consists of four distinct seasons and an average precipitation of 13 inches, a large part of which comes in the form of snow during the winter months of December to March. Elevation levels in the Modoc range from 9,906 feet at Eagle Peak in the South Warner Wilderness, to 4,000 feet in the valleys.

There are ample opportunities for hiking, backpacking, horseback riding, hunting and fishing. The Modoc is home of more than 300 species of wildlife. The Pacific Flyway crosses directly over the area. During their migration from Alaska and Canada to Mexico, hundreds of thousands of waterfowl use local wetlands as rest stops. Rocky Mountain elk, wild horses, mule deer, and pronghorn antelope are some of the large, unique mammals that call the Modoc their home.

Electric poles already at the road, which is also paved.  This is very rare for the area, it's mostly dirt roads without power yet.

W...Sometimes, looking at things from a new perspective gives you a different feeling. Weve all seen trains go down the tracks before. Weve all seen them enter tunnels. Weve even been aboard one before. Theres something special about watching a long train make a loop, enter a tunnel below itself, and come out the other side. The feeling is so special they even made an observatory for it. The famous Tehachapi Loop is an amazing feat of ingenuity in engineering. Completed in 1876, the structure has remained largely unchanged today. Check it out. Its only a 30-minute drive up north.

All roads are county and state maintained which provide you permanent, legal access to your
property. All of the lots have been surveyed, staked and marked for identification. This was
done many years ago. Some of the corner markers may be difficult to locate without a metal
detector. To establish a physical address and questions regarding zoning and planning call
Costilla County 719-672-9109.

WHAT ABOUT WATER?

You will have several options for water all of which are at your sole expense. They include
drilling a new water well or having water delivered to a water tank you have installed. It is
estimated the depth of the water well will be between 100-200 feet. It is difficult to estimate an
exact cost of drilling a new water well. This will depend upon the company you hire to drill the
well. Prices may vary between different companies from $15 to $55 per foot. We encourage you
to fully investigate every company offering this service and not base your decision solely on the
price. There is no assurance that a productive well can be installed on your land and, if it
cannot, no refund of the purchase price will be made. The purity and chemical content of the
water cannot be determined until each individual well is completed and tested. Contact a
Licensed Colorado Well driller for further information and proposed costs and contact county for
required permits.

WHAT ABOUT UTILITIES?
Electrical lines are several miles away from your land. You will be responsible for any cost of
installation. It costs approximately $5 per foot to extend electrical lines. If you would like to
contact the electric company to find out how much it will cost to run the electrical lines to your
land, you may contact them at: San Luis Valley Rural Electric Cooperative, 719-852-3538 or
800-332-7634. As a way to reduce your costs (both initially and over the long-term), we
recommend you explore the use of alternative/renewal energy sources such as generators,
wind or solar systems for your electrical needs. Both the Federal government and the State of
Colorado have had programs to assist in the payment of a new solar system. The use of
alternative power source will save you a lot of money. In this area, all you will need is a septic
tank and leech field system for your cabin or home. For prices, check with a hardware store.
Before installation of a septic system, a permit must be obtained from the County Health Officer
in San Luis, Colorado. Further information about utilities and who to contact can be provided
upon request.

MAY I USE THE LAND WHILE I'M PAYING FOR IT AND WHEN DO I RECEIVE A DEED
TO MY PROPERTY?
Yes, beginning the very day you sign the purchase contract, the land is yours to use and enjoy.

CAN I RESELL MY PROPERTY IN THE FUTURE AND MAKE A PROFIT?
While there is no guarantee of profit from any land sale, historically land prices have increased
in value. We believe there are many reasons for this upward trend, including inflation,
population growth, a decreasing supply of land, the public's desire for a more natural
environment, trend toward movement away from urban areas and the increasing popularity of
outdoor recreational activities.

IS THERE A PROPERTY OWNERS ASSOCIATION OR ANY RESTRICTIONS ON THE
PROPERTY?
There is no property owners association. Restrictions and land uses are governed by the
Costilla County Planning Department . We highly suggest contacting their office or website for
specifics regarding the uses of your land.

DOES A BUYER HAVE TO BUILD A HOUSE WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME FRAME?
A buyer is never obligated to a timeframe to build on their property.

WHAT IS THE PROPERTY ZONED AND WHAT ARE THE PROPERTY TAXES FOR A
PARCEL?
The property is zoned Residential Vacant Land. Currently, the approximate annual property
taxes calculate to approximately $100 per year but can vary by parcel.

WHAT ARE MOST PEOPLE PLANNING TO DO WITH THEIR LAND?
Most property owners feel that it is a good opportunity to own a nice lot, yet affordable piece of
Colorado. The unique proximity of this property to Alamosa will allow owners to enjoy a country
lifestyle while living just minutes away from the amenities a city has to offer. Some owners plan
to make their property into a second home, while others plan to move to their property after
retirement. Many plan to pass it down to their children or grandchildren, while others plan to
possibly subdivide the property at a later date, keeping some acreage and selling the rest. Many
of the property owners also plan to utilize the property as a permanent home or a recreational
retreat or getaway from the hustle and bustle of the big city. These lots are ready for you to build
your dream home or just enjoy the good feeling of land ownership.",7500,5,71567870,"37.1677, -105.6254",75,"https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-3765449815,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-3765449954,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-3765449955,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-3765449956,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-3765449958,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-3765449957,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-3765450058,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-3765450054,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-3765450057,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-3765450055,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-3765450056,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-3765450059,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-3917649203,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-3917649206,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-3917649208,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-3917649204,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-3917649207,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-3917649205,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-3917649209,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-3917649210"

This is a nice one acre parcel located in the northern section of the Estancia Ranchettes subdivision. Conveniently located just east of Albuquerque off of I-40 exit 203. Out here you can get away from the crowds of town yet still be close enough to drop in when you like.

Currently, several residents call it home. The land is relatively flat with beautiful views of the Sandia Mountains to the northwest and Manzano Mountains to the south. This is a legally recorded subdivision so you have guaranteed legal access to the lot through platted roads or easements, so no parcel is landlocked. There are no HOA or CC&R's, so you are free to use the property as you see fit. You may use an RV on the property for up to 3 months a year (or 6 months if actively building) and there is no time limit to build (mobiles OK here). 

Mor...Moriarty and Edgewood
The east valley is the fastest growing area near Albuquerque. Edgewood's population grew 97% between 2000 and 2010, and has had slower, but steady growth since. Both commercial and residential real estate are being snatched up as soon as it hits the market. Now is your chance to own a piece of the area before prices skyrocket. 

The Moriarty/Edgewood area is about 15 miles to the west and it is less than a 30 minute drive to the Albuquerque city limits (and less than 50 miles from Santa Fe)! Much of the growth has been related to the expanding Albuquerque Metropolitan Area.

The east valley provides an exciting environment in which to live, work, or own a business. With a robust economy, rapidly growing regional population, and excellent transportation infrastructure, it provides convenient access to the Albuquerque market as well as those of Santa Fe, Estancia, and Mountainair. Much of the regional population east of Albuquerque comes to either Moriarty or Edgewood for shopping, dining, and entertainment.

Piece for Peace: Stunning Landscape with lots of Trees! 

Want a place where you can just enjoy nature yourself? Are you familiar with northeastern Arizona? It is reachable mostly by interstate and one acre plots are pretty common. It has a high elevation and is quite different from the high heat of Phoenix and Tucson. It even gets a bit of snow in the winter. And there are trees - yes you heard that right! Its also removed from the big city with lots of open land at the right price!

If you a...Apache County is known for having some of the fewest restrictions of any county in Arizona. There are no specific regulations for camping. If you are going to be on your land for more than 30 days, however, make sure you know that the health department will want you to have a septic system. This and most of the land in the county is zoned as agricultural which gives you lots of options.

Many lots in Apache county do not have utilities. Some people find that solar is a good option. Water is often hauled in or delivered. Property taxes are low, although part of that is because the county only maintains certain roads. There are other roads, called N roads that are not maintained. Some of them are better than others. You may need an all-wheel drive vehicle to get to some places and it may also depend on the weather.

One nearby attraction is the beautiful Petrified Forest National Park. There are also several National Forests that are not too far away: Apache-Sitgraves, Coconino, Prescott, Kaibab, and Gila National Forests. 

This particular property is actually three adjoining lots so you get 3.03 acres to the northwest of the small town of Sanders. You can get there by leaving the frontage road along Interstate 40 and offroading about a mile northward. Spread out all you want!

The subdivision has all roads in place and every lot is accessible. You can build up to a 200 square foot structure with a median roof height of no more than 10' without a building permit. There are several cabins and storage structures already built in the area. We saw a freshly constructed storage/weather bunker being constructed last time we visited. 

The primary attractions in the area are fishing, camping, hunting, hiking, and any other outdoor activity you can think of. This property is situated between Deadhorse and Campbell lakes, offering wonderful fishing opportunities. Scenic vistas of the lakes and the surrounding country are found throughout this system, but particularly from the heights of Campbell and Dead Horse Rims. On a clear day the distant views from these lofty viewpoints are spectacular and limited only by the curvature of the Earth.

At a maximum depth of 350 feet, summer water temperatures can still reach 75 degrees. Having no outlet, water leaves the lake only by evaporation.

Reno
Dubbed as ""The Biggest Little City in the World"" Reno has the gambling, dining, and entertainment of Las Vegas to the South, but with a little more charm. While casinos line the main drag, there is much more to Reno than just the gambling. Reno has all services and amenities of any major city. It is also just a short drive to Lake Tahoe which hosts some of the best skiing in the world.

Piece for Peace: Get your piece of Apache County 

Apache County sits in north eastern Arizona. If you are not familiar with this part of Arizona, it is definitely different from the high heat of Phoenix and Tucson. It even gets some snow in the winter time! Some of the land has trees. Being away from the big city there is a lot of open land and the price is right!

Apache County is also known for having some of the fewest restrictions of any county in Arizona. Unlike some other places, there are no specific regulations for camping. If you are going to be on your land for more than 30 days, however, the sanitation department will...Apache County is also known for having some of the fewest restrictions of any county in Arizona. Unlike some other places, there are no specific regulations for camping. If you are going to be on your land for more than 30 days, however, the sanitation department will want to make sure you have a septic system. Most of the land in the county is generally zoned as agricultural which gives you lots of options on what to do with the land.

Many lots in Apache county do not have utilities. Some people find that solar is a good option. Water is often hauled in or delivered. Property taxes are low, although part of that is because the county only maintains certain roads. There are other roads, called N roads that are not maintained. Some of them are better than others. You may need an all-wheel drive vehicle to get to some places and it may also depend on the weather.

One attraction to check out is the beautiful Petrified Forest National Park. There are also several National Forests that are not too far away: Apache-Sitgraves, Coconino, Prescott, Kaibab, and Gila National Forests. 

This particular property is 1.16 acres and is not far from the small town of Sanders. You can get there by getting on Interstate 40 and taking it to US Highway 191 before taking some county roads and then going off-road for the remainder of the trip. There are trees on this property which might be a surprise for some!

Two adjacent lots located in the Fremont National Forest in the south-central Oregon mountains. Lakeview Pine Estates is a unique subdivision. It is the only small acreage private land in this high mountain lake area, easily accessible in the summer months on well paved and groomed gravel and dirt roads. With an elevation near 7000, in the winter 4X4 and/or ATV/snowmobiles are required to access the land.

These parcels are the perfect summer get away for your private camping spot. The subdivision has all roads in place and every lot is accessible.

The subdivision has all roads in place and every lot is accessible. You can build up to a 200 square foot structure with a median roof height of no more than 10' without a building permit. There are several cabins and storage structures already built in the area. We saw a freshly constructed storage/weather bunker being constructed last time we visited. 

The primary attractions in the area are fishing, camping, hunting, hiking, and any other outdoor activity you can think of. This property is situated between Deadhorse and Campbell lakes, offering wonderful fishing opportunities. Scenic vistas of the lakes and the surrounding country are found throughout this system, but particularly from the heights of Campbell and Dead Horse Rims. On a clear day the distant views from these lofty viewpoints are spectacular and limited only by the curvature of the Earth.

Beautifully forested area, in a valley surrounded by the Rocky Mountains.
The bends in the creek make for excellent gold...The bends in the creek make for excellent gold catching areas.
The mountain ridges are great places for gems.
Jackson County is known as the moose viewing capitol of Colorado,

National Forests remained open at all times during the virus with a televised invitation by the Director for families to visit them as safe places for family recreation, making our mining claims some of the safest places for your family to enjoy and get away from all the nonsense.

Rockhounding in Colorado 
Starting with the rich gold and silver deposits which were the starting point of so many Colorado towns, the Centennial State, with over 770 types of minerals to be found, is second only to California in the number of different gems and minerals statewide.
Colorado is also host to a dizzying array of rocks and minerals. Some of the higher profile include dinosaur fossils.
Colorado can certainly be considered a rockhound and gem hunters dream. 
The vast mountains of national forests gives one a newfound sense of exploration and discovery.

Jackson County has miles and miles of snowmobile trails to add to your mining claim experience.
See the snowmobile trail map with the pictures.

To purchase our claim, the process would be, I would need your name(s) and addresswhere I would scan and email you a signed contract, and which payment option you choose:

Gold prices reached an all time high of $2000 per ounce.

The river on this claim runs thru a beautiful meadow, and the meadows in this area are unique to the Rocky Mountains.
River runs just off the road all along the road making for easy access.

Like many of the tributaries of the North Platte River in this area called North Park, the Illinois River holds a variety of trout and is known as a great fishing river.

Besides gold, this area is also known for having precious and semi-precious gemstones, including the state named gemstone aquamarine, and gems such as turquoise, crystals, opals, topaz, amethyst, and smoky quartz.

I am a retired teacher, and got into prospecting as a hobby with my family.
I am 72 and my wife 69, and we have gained the experience to select the best areas to locate claims.

We feel we are selling more than the gold and minerals on beautiful land.
You would be acquiring an experience that will give you a good feel for what the old time prospectors must have felt during the days of the original Colorado Gold Rush.

A mining claim is an affordable way to enjoy the beauty of the land combined with the adventure of panning for gold.

If within one year you are not satisfied with your claim, you can trade for another comparable claim, just paying the BLM and County transfer fees which will be about $125.

Claim buyer will also receive a new, free, Gold Panning Kit:
One 14 inch Gold Trap pan; One 10.5 inch Gravity Trap pan, One combination sifter/classifier with 7/16 of an inch exit holes, One Gold Guzzler snuffer bottle, One Tweezers/ Magnifying Glass combo tool.

Mining Claims as an investment: if you purchase a claim from us, at no charge, I would help you if you ever decided to sell in the future.
Mining Claims are a great investment, as claims go up in value over time, just as land does.

The Illinois River is a tributary of the further north Michigan River and before that the historically gold rich Platte River.  The Michigan River and Platte River are all claimed up, and with gold always traveling downstream, the Illinois River has excellent gold panning potential, as we discovered in our own prospecting, and along with the beauty of the area, makes for an awesome area to camp and prospect.
There are no more areas on this Illinois River to locate a claim.

Owning a mining claim is having access to a lifetime of great family fun and recreation, in a very beautiful, natural setting.
This county is known as the Moose Viewing Capital of Colorado, and we had a moose sighting while we were there.

This is a 20 acre unpatented, gold mining placer claim, the Jackson County Gold #1, with the beautiful Illinois River running thru the claim, in the Rocky Mountains, and the Routt National Forest. The claim is legally registered with the Bureau of Land Management out of Lakewood, CO and Jackson County. You own the mineral rights, not sharing with others, on the 20 acres, and use your 20 acres recreationally for camping and prospecting in an awesome, beautiful area.
Great secluded valley, with flatter claim areas for camping. Easy walk to the Illinois River, not too far from the Rocky Mountain National Park, and less than an hour from the Wyoming border.

For the possibility of constructing any building you or others could live in, you need to file a Plan of Operation with the BLM for approval, showing you have developed a full-time operation performing diligent mining.  The BLM is reluctant to approve anything to live in.
You do not need a plan, permission nor a permit to camp and prospect.
You do not need to be a full time prospector to file a Plan for a shed type structure.

With an approved BLM Plan of Operation, a building can be built on the land: any building that benefits and improves the claim, though you cannot live on a mining claim. 
As stated by the BLM, this can be the ""construction of a building, road, fence, or enclosure necessary for mining.""
Current usage, is what the BLM calls, Casual Use: panning, shovel, rock hammer, metal detector, creek powered sluice box, where no permission nor permit is needed to camp and prospect.

On our visits to the claim, we gathered in and around the river, approx. 1/8 of an ounce of gold, being worth about $220. As the BLM does not specify the amount of gold to be found to locate a claim other than gold needs to be discovered, we use this amount for a 20 acre claim as a projection of good gold potential. Someone with more time may find more. Gold prices are over $1600/ounce. Though we could never guarantee what you will find, we did locate this claim in an historically rich area for gold prospecting.
Gold in the past 3 years has gone up over $400 per ounce.

You are allowed to post No Trespassing for Prospecting signs in and around the claim.
A mining claim owner may limit or restrict public recreational use of/or public access across claims or portions of claims that are actively used for prospecting, mining, or processing operations where public recreational use of a claim would endanger or materially interfere with legitimate mining pursuits.

Camp on your claim or nearby national forest campgrounds.
A claim owner does not need permission nor a permit to camp and prospect.
You can prospect as little or as much as you like.
Now that we have located the claims, you never have to declare to the BLM any gold or gems you find.

Welcome to North Park - Jackson County, Colorado!
Raw, remote, tucked deep in Colorados rugged Rockies, the high valley of North Park and its County of Jackson literally scream frontier and a past fast-held in present days. Holding true to rough and rugged times when native hunters, trappers, prospectors, and early ranchers survived off its lands and forged its history, North Park is the real West, where travelers can embrace what once was, while happily escaping what now is.
With over a million acres covering more than 1600 square miles; 65% public land; lakes, rivers and reservoirs that attract and support unique and abundant wildlife; and access to five of Colorados most rugged and pristine wilderness areas  North Park lies at the center of a minimally used and amazingly untapped recreation universe.
Light on links to the world-wide web, with mall shopping, bright lights and traffic jams at least 65 paved-miles away, it is removed from civilization, but easily accessed by civilized folk in search of solitude. Raw, Rough, Real  make your getaway to North Park this year. Unplug to plug in  disconnect from your life and reconnect with your soul.
As heavy mist rises from the lush, valley floor of Colorados North Park, a flaming Western sun gently layers the 360 horizon with pinks, reds, purples, and shimmering golds. As a large bull moose appears, disappears, and reappears along one of many river paths, a playful otter splashes ducks intent on finding breakfast in a nearby beaver pond.
And, as passing moments become priceless memories, the raw nature of North Park and Jackson County awakens the frontiersman in us all and leaves us wanting more.
North Park is truly a land of wonders, where your mind can rest, while your spirit soars.

The river on the claim is a unique advantage for gold prospecting.
Gold always occurs in gravels in the metallic state and when so found has various physical characteristics. Gold is dense and heavy, it has a characteristic metallic color, and it is soft and easily malleable (it is easily formed by hammering). These are the characteristics used by prospectors to identify gold in the field.
Placer gold occurs on the claim as small grains derived from gossan formed by weathering, and oxidation of the gold, copper and iron rich veins. Gold also occurs as grains flakes and small nuggets derived from the erosion of mineralized fault zones on, and upstream from the claim.

TERMS

Total price of $3500, that can be paid in one full payment where your ownership is then transferred after receiving payment,

You can use the claim as yours while making monthly payments.
Ownership transfer after final monthly payment.
A signed contract will precede payment.   

After receiving your final payment, your ownership of the 20 acre claim will be legally recorded with the local Bureau of Land Management and Jackson County. The quit claim deed is the correct document to be recorded for a mining claim, as stated by the BLM. This is not a sharing with others of your 20 acre claim.

We live in Ohio. Our connection to Colorado is our daughter lives in Denver, though she is not involved with our claims. We visited her in September, then went to prospect and locate mining claims, as we have been doing for a number of years.

And just a note of encouragement for you if purchase:
My wife and I have located, prospected on, and sold mining claims in 
California, Colorado, & Arizona, going on now for over 25 years.
You can trust we will process your notarized deeds correctly and quickly.
In that mining claims are processed thru the Bureau of Land Management, a Federal Govt. agency, not following thru per our legally signed contract, would be a federal crime. I certainly will do what I say, and would never put myself nor my wife in any legal jeopardy.
Also, we have sold properties on 4 sites online for over 25 years:
Landsalelistings, Landwatch, LandsofAmerica, and LandandFarm.
Our continued good status on these sites is due to our always following thru, as just one time we would not, we would not be allowed to sell on these sites ever again.

Located about 11 miles SE of the quaint mountain town of Gold Canyon that has all the necessities, about 18 miles SE of the larger city of Apache Junction, and 52 miles East of Phoenix, I...Located about 11 miles SE of the quaint mountain town of Gold Canyon that has all the necessities, about 18 miles SE of the larger city of Apache Junction, and 52 miles East of Phoenix, In Pinal County, Arizona. 
The views of the Superstition Mountain, along with evening sunsets, makes Gold Canyon one of the most picturesque areas in all of Arizona.

This historical area of the Superstition Mountains has the most desired claims and lives up to its reputation that is so widespread. 
The legend of the Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine centers around the Superstition Mountains. According to the legend, a German immigrant named Jacob Waltz discovered a mother lode of gold in the Superstition Wilderness and revealed its location on his deathbed in Phoenix in 1891 to Julia Thomas, a boarding-house owner who had taken care of him for many years.
Many since then, and even today, search for the Lost Dutchman Mine, including the TV series, Legends of the Superstition Mountains.

National Forests remained open at all times during the virus with a televised invitation by the Director for families to visit them as safe places for family recreation, making our mining claims some of the safest places for your family to enjoy and get away from all the nonsense.

Another good sign for our claims here are the other experienced prospectors who have claims in this same area before us.

A large, extended wash runs thru the claim being a good place for gold deposits.
The wash on the claim is a great advantage for prospecting, especially when the summer rains run down the wash, then depositing gold flakes down from the mountains, buttes, and rock formations.

Up the mountain buttes on the claim are good areas to explore for gems with your rock hammer.
Besides gold, this is also a great place to hunt for specimen rocks and other gemstones as agate and ruby red garnets are often found in this geological region.
Arrowheads and relics are often found in this area dating back to the Apaches.

The Superstition Mountains are a rock collectors heaven including an abundance of gemstones.
This area has one of the longest histories of gemstone production.
Arizona ranks first for where all of the natural gems are located and is famous for its turquoise and petrified wood.

ARIZONA ROCKHOUDING
Arizona is one of the best states in the United States for finding gemstones in the wild. Gemstones can be found all across the state of Arizona, and over eight main types of rocks and minerals can be collected there. Arizona is an incredible place to rockhound, not just because of its diversity of native gemstones but also because of its beautiful natural landscapes. 

Rockhounding is more than just a hobby; it is a lifestyle. Arizona is a fantastic place to find rocks, minerals, and crystals that can be displayed in a collection, made into jewelry, or sold to local jewelry and rock and mineral stores. There are also a variety of Arizona-based rock and gem shows that you can attend or even sell your own specimens.

This is a 20 acre unpatented, gold and gem mining claim, the Apache Gold #5 placer claim. 
The claim is legally registered with the Bureau of Land Management out of Phoenix and the Pinal County. You own the mineral rights, not sharing with others, on the 20 acres, and use your 20 acres, recreationally for camping: tent, camper, or RV, and prospecting, with beautiful views of nearby mountain ranges and rock formations. 
Great combination of good access with the town of Gold Canyon nearby, wilderness beauty, and gold and gem prospecting potential. 

See the listing onsite pictures, showing one of the most beautiful areas in Arizona. 
This claim is surrounded by mountain views. Located in the Tonto National Forest and the Superstition Mountains.
Location Monument is a 4 foot wood post that has been placed, with an attached copy of our Location Notice, as required by the Arizona BLM.

For the possibility of constructing any building you or others could live in, you need to file a Plan of Operation with the BLM for approval, showing you have developed a full-time operation performing diligent mining, though the BLM is reluctant to approve anything to live in.
You do not need a plan, permission nor a permit to camp and prospect.
You do not need to be a full time prospector to file a Plan for a shed type structure.

With an approved BLM Plan of Operation, a building can be built on the land: any building that benefits and improves the claim, though is not likely anything to live in will be approved.
As stated by the BLM, this can be the ""construction of a building, road, fence, or enclosure necessary for mining.""
Current usage, is what the BLM calls, Casual Use: panning, shovel, rock hammer, metal detector, creek powered sluice box, where no permission nor permit is needed to camp and prospect.
You can prospect as little or as much as you like.
Now that we have located the claim, you never have to declare to the BLM any gold or gems you find.

On our trips to the claim, we found about 1/8 of an ounce of gold in and around the extended wash on the claim, value approx. $225. Those with more time to prospect may find more. Today's gold prices are over $1900/ounce. 
Though we could never guarantee what you will find, we did locate this claim in an historically rich area for gold prospecting.
We also found some nice specimens of crystals, fire agate, and chrysocolla.
I know of no more accessible areas in these mountains to locate a claim, as the whole area is claimed up, many being long time prospectors.
Gold prices have gone up $500 per ounce in the past few years.

You are allowed to post No Trespassing for Prospecting signs in and around the claim.
A mining claim owner may limit or restrict public recreational use of/or public access across claims or portions of claims that are actively used for prospecting, mining, or processing operations where public recreational use of a claim would endanger or materially interfere with legitimate mining pursuits.

20 acres = 660 ft. x 1320 ft.

An unpatented mining claim is a specific parcel of federal land, valuable for a specific mineral deposit or deposits. It is a parcel for which an individual has asserted a legal right of possession and the right to develop and extract a discovered, valuable, mineral deposit. Mining claims are real property that you can buy, sell, or inherit. After proving the existence of valuable minerals on the land, the claim is legally recorded with the Bureau of Land Management, and Pinal county. 

Gold always occurs in gravels in the metallic state and when so found has various physical characteristics. Gold is dense and heavy, it has a characteristic metallic color, and it is soft and easily malleable (it is easily formed by hammering). These are the characteristics used by prospectors to identify gold in the field. Placer gold occurs on the claim as small grains derived from gossan formed by weathering, and oxidation of the gold, copper and iron rich veins. Gold also occurs as grains flakes and small nuggets derived from the erosion of mineralized fault zones. 

The Federal Government owns the land. 
You are purchasing the mineral rights. 
You can legally camp for free, with camper and RV on the whole 20 acres. 
A claim owner does not need permission nor a permit to camp and prospect.

After your final monthly payment, I will process 2 notarized deeds, transferring my claim ownership over to you, with both the BLM and Pinal county. 

We live in Ohio.. Our connection to the West is our daughter lives in Denver, though she is not involved with our claims, and we had a vacation home in Arizona; though now sold, we still go to AZ to explore, prospect, and locate claims, as we have been doing for a number of years. 

And just a note of encouragement for you if purchase:
My wife and I have located, prospected on, and sold mining claims in
California, Colorado, & Arizona, going on now for over 25 years.
You can trust we will process your notarized deeds correctly and quickly.
In that mining claims are processed thru the Bureau of Land Management, a
Federal Govt. agency, not following thru per our legally signed contract, would be a federal crime. I certainly will do what I say, and would never put myself nor my wife in any legal jeopardy.
Also, we have sold properties on 4 sites online for over 25 years:
Landsalelistings, Landwatch, LandandFarm, and LandsofAmerica.
Our continued good status on these sites is due to our always following thru, as just one time we would not, we would not be allowed to sell on these sites ever again.

COMMENTS FROM SATISFIED CLAIM BUYERS:

""We live in Arizona and purchased a mining claim from Mr. Leu.
The claim is everything as advertised.  The Superstition Mountains make for awesome views. We have camped on our claim a number of times and have found gold in the wash on our claim. We are very happy with our purchase.

Living in another state, we were a little skeptical on buying a mining claim in Arizona. But our personal experience with Mr. Leu has been a family blessing.
Our camping and prospecting on our claim has brought our family closer together.
We were so pleased, we bought a claim in Colorado from Mr. Leu, and are looking to buy one also in California as we look to plan family vacations around our claims. 

Thanks Michael. We took our girls to the campsite area closest to the claim last weekend.
It was a great experience. Were really looking forward to raising them up to be adventure seekers, nature loves and Creation appreciators. This claim has already brought and provided a wonderful experience for my family.

Piece for Peace: Your Own Off-Grid bug-out!

Ever wanted a place that was far enough away from civilization to be out of the way but not so far out that you couldnt get there? A place to get away to if there ever was an emergency in the city or a place just to get away from the city and relax? Maybe build something one of these days? This plot is about a mile away from both Highway 191 and Interstate 40. You are far enough away from the roads to hear the traffic but not so far away that you have to go for miles off-road. 

Apache County has some of the fewest restrictions of any county in Arizona. There are no specific regulation...Apache County has some of the fewest restrictions of any county in Arizona. There are no specific regulations for camping. If you are going to be on your land for more than 30 days, however, make sure you know that the health department will want you to have a septic system. This and most of the land in the county is zoned as agricultural which gives you lots of options.

Many lots in Apache county do not have utilities. Some people find that solar is a good option. Water is often hauled in or delivered. Property taxes are low, although part of that is because the county only maintains certain roads. There are other roads, called N roads that are not maintained. Some of them are better than others. You may need an all-wheel drive vehicle to get to some places and it may also depend on the weather.

One nearby attraction is the beautiful Petrified Forest National Park. There are also several National Forests that are not too far away: Apache-Sitgraves, Coconino, Prescott, Kaibab, and Gila National Forests. 

This particular property is a 1 acre piece of land not far from Sanders or Chambers.

Tres Piedras lies less than 20 minutes northwest of Taos off highway 64. Named for three outcroppings of granite, the community was once a popular stop on the Chili Line railroad running between Antonito, CO and Santa Fe NM. With wide open spaces, Tres Piedras is a wonderful spot to build a permanent home or just visit with your RV. Either way you are encouraged to take advantage of all of the outdoor adventures the area has to offer.

It's wedged between the towering peaks of the Rocky Mountains and the plunging chasm of the Rio Grande Gorge. Located about 70 miles north of Santa Fe, this is a town of 6,000 residents. There are plenty of mainstream attractions -- Taos boasts some of the best restaurants in the state, a hot and funky arts scene, and incredible outdoors action, including world-class skiing.

The history of Taos may be much different if the railroad had not bypassed the area in favor of Santa Fe in the late 1800's. Soon after many artists began to migrate to the area to paint the dramatic scenery afforded by the unparalleled terrain. As time went on more and more artists of all disciplines began to move to the area forming a culture that remains today. It is estimated that 20-25% of all residents in the area are artists (painters, sculptures, writers, or musicians). 

The city of Taos is merely the focal point of rugged 2,200-square-mile Taos County. Two features dominate this sparsely populated region: the high desert mesa, split in two by the 650-foot-deep gorge of the Rio Grande and the Sangre de Cristo range, which tops out at 13,161-foot Wheeler Peak, the highest point in New Mexico. From the forested uplands to the sage-carpeted mesa, the county is home to a large variety of wildlife.

The purpose of Off Grid Acres, LLC is to Empower People to achieve their dream of a more independent, more fulfilling and less environmentally impactful lifestyle.  I love owning land and the feeling of freedom I get when doing whatever I want on it - whether that's raising chickens and honeybees, planting fruit trees or hunting my next meal.  I want to share that delight with my customers.      

I support more sustainable lifestyle opportunities such as Tiny Homes, Bus/RV living or more traditional homesteading by sourcing and selling raw land.    

Buying raw land can be stressful and scary  this is something most people will not do during their lifetime.  Even realtors and lenders often have little experience in vacant land.  I can help reduce the stress and worry you may be feeling when buying raw land.  I make buying land a simple process and explain the steps in purchasing land.  I only sell land with confirmed and documented legal access, I always have a title search performed to verify a clear and marketable title when I purchase land and I offer warranty deeds on all my parcels.",16500,10,N/A,"37.996659999999999, -82.287090000000006",22,"https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4085215740,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4085224833,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4085230791,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4085215822,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4085225837,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4085217276,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4085217277,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4085217281,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4085230792,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4085217286,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4085216007,https://assets.landwatch.com/resizedimages/0/2000/w/800/1-4085216449"

ARIZONA ROCKHOUDING
Arizona is one of the best states in the United States for finding gemstones in the wild. Gemstones can be found all across the state of Arizona, and over eight main types of rocks and minerals can be collected there. Arizona is an incredible place to rockhound, not just because of its diversity of native gemstones but also because of its beautiful natural landscapes. 

Rockhounding is more than just a hobby; it is a lifestyle. Arizona is a fantastic place to find rocks, minerals, and crystals that can be displayed in a collection, made into jewelry, or sold to local jewelry and rock and mineral stores. There are also a variety of Arizona-based rock and gem shows that you can attend or even sell your own specimens.

Arizona, The Grand Canyon State, is obviously no stranger to rocks and gemstones. 
Arizona is one of the highest caliber rockhounding states and receives visitors from all corners of the world in search of Arizona gold, rocks, gemstones, minerals and fossils which find themselves scattered across this geologic treasure trove.
Theres a reason that one of the largest gem and mineral shows in the world is held in Arizona. Every winter in Tucson, Arizona, exhibitors from all over the world come together to show off their collections of rocks, gemstones and minerals.

Several long washes are on the claim to multiply your gold prospecting potential.
These are good place for gold, and the surrounding area of buttes and mountains are good places for gems.
For you off roaders, a jeep climb is in the area to test your adventure driving, known as the Diamond Back Sedona Hill Climb.

Owning a mining claim is having access to a lifetime of great family fun and recreation, in a very beautiful, natural setting: Arizona, is a great, scenic state, where the spirit of the old west still lives on. 
Mining Claims are also a great investment, as claims go up in value over time, just as land does.
if you purchase a claim from us, at no charge, I would help you if you ever decided to sell in the future.

Yavapai County where our claims are located in the central part of Arizona, ranks first historically in the State in gold production.

Though mineral deposits were known in this area long before the Civil War, the first prospectors were Union soldiers with mining experience from California.

We are especially excited about the gems you will find in this area.
Known also as a gem area, when the rains start coming, Verde Valley rockhounds come running. The gem hunting in this area is so popular that a large club is active in Sedona.
Quartz is abundant and is also an area for crystals, turquoise, amethyst, jasper, agates, opals and some can be found above ground.
The Sedona Rockhounding Club has one area they explore being from Sedona stretching southwest to the town of Crown King.
Our claims are in this direct path for gem exploration.
We found quartz, agates, and crystals on this claim.

Yavapai County is one of the four original Arizona counties formed in September of 1864, one year after the Arizona Territory was established. The County was named after the Yavapai Tribe, whose name means the people of the sun.
Yavapai County is a land of deep character and changing terrain. Views are far-reaching capped by clear blue skies. Prehistoric remains of the Sinaguan people are tucked into sandstone ledges and prominent hilltops. Area lakes are nestled in the pines surrounded by thousands of miles of hiking, biking, and horseback riding trails. The real spirit of the West is fully alive in this timeless territory.

Sedona is red rock country. Multi-hued stone formations jut upwards from the high desert floor creating a vivid, mesmerizing setting that changes hourly with the light. When USA Weekend compiled their Most Beautiful Places in America list, Sedona claimed the top spot. Surrounded by 1.8 million acres of national forest land, visitors have instant access to recreational activities. Trails for hiking and biking, along with bouncy jeep tracks, weave among the bristling forest of pinnacles, spires, buttes and domes. Yet, you are never far from the indulgences of town.
Sedona is equal parts rugged, equal parts resort. Regarded by Native Americans as sacred, Sedona continues to be recognized as a place of healing and spiritual renewal. Many come to experience the vortex energy centers of Sedona. Others want to prowl the 40-plus art galleries lining the streets, or to receive soothing treatments from the dozens of spa facilities. Most recently, with its nearby vineyards and tasting rooms, Sedona has emerged as a destination for wine enthusiasts.
Many Westerns have been filmed in this area, going back to the late, great John Wayne.

The Grand Canyon is 2 hours north, and there are day tours out of Sedona.

It is a parcel for which an individual has asserted a legal right of possession and the right to develop and extract a discovered, valuable, mineral deposit. Mining claims are real property that you can buy, sell, or inherit. After proving the existence of valuable minerals on the land, the claim is legally recorded with the Bureau of Land Management, and Yavapai County.

Gold always occurs in gravels in the metallic state and when so found has various physical characteristics. Gold is dense and heavy, it has a characteristic metallic color, and it is soft and easily malleable (it is easily formed by hammering). These are the characteristics used by prospectors to identify gold in the field. Placer gold occurs on the claim as small grains derived from gossan formed by weathering, and oxidation of the gold, copper and iron rich veins. Gold also occurs as grains flakes and small nuggets derived from the erosion of mineralized fault zones.

COMMENTS FROM SATISFIED CLAIM BUYERS:

""We live in Arizona and purchased a mining claim from Mr. Leu.
The claim is everything as advertised.  The area red rock formations make for awesome views. We have camped on our claim a number of times and have found gold in the wash on our claim and a lot of gems on the claim buttes. We are very happy with our purchase.

Living in another state, we were a little skeptical on buying a mining claim in Arizona. But our personal experience with Mr. Leu has been a family blessing.
Our camping and prospecting on our claim has brought our family closer together.

Cedar City
The county seat for Iron County, Cedar City is surrounded by 10,000 foot mountains to the east and a vast desert to the west. Cedar City's economy is based on tourism, agriculture, mining and Southern Utah State University. With a population of over 30,000 people, Cedar City has all of the amenities anyone needs.

Cedar City's economy is based on tourism, agriculture, mining and Southern Utah State University. With a population of over 30,000 people, Cedar City has all of the amenities anyone needs. The area has experienced rapid growth over the last 30 years, and it does not appear to be declining. From shopping to dining, Cedar City has dozens of options of each. The city has full medical services and a highly rated school system. While the weather is vastly different, due to their proximity, Cedar City and St. George share cultural ties.  

St. George
A slightly longer drive than Cedar City, but a city with nearly three times the population. Located near the Utah, Arizona, and Nevada borders, St. George sits at the edge of the Mojave Desert. The city is located less than two hours from Las Vegas and is the most populated city in Utah located outside the Wasatch Front. The area is consistently among the fastest growing and most desirable places to live lists published in the last ten years.  

Climate
Cedar City's climate is the typical cool semi-arid climate of the Mountain West, though snowfall can be quite heavy. With around 250 days of sunshine, summer highs are in the 90's and winter lows fall to the teens. This makes it an ideal climate for both summer and winter recreation. In contrast, St George has an abundant amount of sunshine year-round. The city averages over 300 sunny days per year, with an average of only 8.80 inches of precipitation annually.

Lander County
Lander County was created in 1862 and was one of the original 11 counties of Nevada when statehood was granted in 1864. Since then, three other counties were formed from it, Elko, Eureka, and White Pine counties. With less than 6,000 residents county wide, Lander county has more room to enjoy and explore the outdoors than some of the other counties in the state. You can explore old western towns like Austin and the county seat, Battle Mountain. Or just make your way into the mountains to enjoy some peace and quiet.

National Forests remained open at all times during the virus with a televised invitation by the Director for families to visit them as safe places for family recreation, making our mining claims some of the safest places for your family to enjoy and get away from all the nonsense.

Large Buttes are on the claim being great places to prospect for gems with your rock hammer, and the gold potential is greater when summer rains bring down any gold and gems from the mountain then deposited into the claim washes.

A pond, Box Tank, is nearby and its water can be used for prospecting.
Water will fluctuate per Summer rains.

These extended washes are good p...Extended washes are on the claim to multiply your gold and gem prospecting potential. These extended washes are good places for gold, and the surrounding area of rock formations buttes and mountains are good places for gems. There are several larger, cleared camping spots on the claim road. Trees are on the claim for shade.

For you off roaders, a jeep climb is down the road to test your adventure driving,
known as the Diamond Back Sedona Hill Climb. See with the pictures maps and satellite views.

It was reported recently, from a neighboring claim, that a tremendous amount of gems was found. It is a good sign for your potential claim that other prospectors have claims in this same area.

Yavapai County ranks first historically in the State in gold production. This claim is in the same area of the Jerome (Verde) Mining District which has a history of being the largest gold producing area in Arizona, having contributed about 1,565,000 ounces of gold over the years, with the county history of gold discoveries being 3,800,000 ounces of gold.

Though mineral deposits were known in this area long before the Civil War, the first prospectors were Union soldiers with mining experience from California.
Known also as a gem area, when the rains start coming, Verde Valley rockhounds come running. The gem hunting in this area is so popular that a large club is active in Sedona.

Quartz is abundant and is also an area for crystals, turquoise, amethyst, jasper, agates, opals and some can be found above ground. The Sedona Rockhounding Club has one area they explore being from Sedona stretching southwest to the town of Crown King. Sedona #12 is in this direct path for gem exploration. Quartz, agates, and crystals have been discovered on this claim.

To purchase the claim, the process would be, I would need your name(s) and mailing address where I would scan and email you a signed contract.
Total price of $6000, that can be paid in one full payment where your ownership is then transferred after receiving payment.

A signed contract will precede payment.

Current Gold Prices are over $1800 per ounce, and climbing. Many are expecting more inflation soon. 
This area also has an abundance of gemstones.

The Sedona Mago Resort is nearby. Cool Village of Oak Creek is just 5 miles south of Sedona. Within hiking distance is the Sedona Wetlands Preserve that attracts a large variety of birds where there is a parking area, restrooms, and picnic benches.

You are buying more than the gold and gems on beautiful land. You would be acquiring an experience that will give you a good feel for what the old time prospectors must have felt during the days of the original Arizona Gold Rush.

A mining claim is an affordable way to enjoy the beauty of the land combined with the adventure of panning for gold and searching for gems.
The washes on the claim are a great advantage for prospecting, especially when the summer rains run down the washes, then depositing gold flakes down from the mountains and rock formations, and which also exposes gem veins.
Owning a mining claim is having access to a lifetime of great family fun and recreation, in a very beautiful, natural setting: Arizona, is a great, scenic state, where the spirit of the old west still lives on.
Mining Claims are also a great investment, as claims go up in value over time, just as land does.
This is a 40 acre unpatented, gold and gem mining claim. The claim is legally registered with the Bureau of Land Management out of Phoenix and Yavapai County. You have exclusive ownership of the minerals on the 40 acre claim. You can use the claim recreationally for camping: tent, camper, or RV, and prospecting. Enjoy stellar views of the Sycamore Canyon and the San Francisco Mountains. The rock formations are breath taking. The claim has everything: good access, wilderness beauty, and gold plus gem prospecting potential.
Yavapai County is one of the four original Arizona counties formed in September of 1864, one year after the Arizona Territory was established. The County was named after the Yavapai Tribe, whose name means the people of the sun.
Yavapai County is a land of deep character and changing terrain. Views are far-reaching capped by clear blue skies. Prehistoric remains of the Sinaguan people are tucked into sandstone ledges and prominent hilltops. Area lakes are nestled in the pines surrounded by thousands of miles of hiking, biking, and horseback riding trails. The real spirit of the West is fully alive in this timeless territory.
Sedona is red rock country. Multi-hued stone formations jut upwards from the high desert floor creating a vivid, mesmerizing setting that changes hourly with the light. When USA Weekend compiled their Most Beautiful Places in America list, Sedona claimed the top spot. Surrounded by 1.8 million acres of national forest land, visitors have instant access to recreational activities. Trails for hiking and biking, along with bouncy jeep tracks, weave among the bristling forest of pinnacles, spires, buttes and domes. Yet, youre never far from the indulgences of town.
Sedona is equal parts rugged, equal parts resort. Regarded by Native Americans as sacred, Sedona continues to be recognized as a place of healing and spiritual renewal. Many come to experience the vortex energy centers of Sedona. Others want to prowl the 40-plus art galleries lining the streets, or to receive soothing treatments from the dozens of spa facilities. Most recently, with its nearby vineyards and tasting rooms, Sedona has emerged as a destination for wine enthusiasts.
Many Westerns have been filmed in this area, going back to the late, great John Wayne.
The Grand Canyon is 2 hours north, and there are day tours out of Sedona.

Gold always occurs in gravels in the metallic state and when so found has various physical characteristics. Gold is dense and heavy, it has a characteristic metallic color, and it is soft and easily malleable (it is easily formed by hammering). These are the characteristics used by prospectors to identify gold in the field. Placer gold occurs on the claim as small grains derived from gossan formed by weathering, and oxidation of the gold, copper and iron rich veins. Gold also occurs as grains flakes and small nuggets derived from the erosion of mineralized fault zones.
Arizona is one of the highest caliber rockhounding states and receives visitors from all corners of the world in search of Arizona rocks, gemstones, minerals and fossils which find themselves scattered across this geologic treasure trove. There's a reason that one of the largest gem and mineral shows in the world is held in Arizona.

The Federal Government owns the land. You are purchasing the mineral rights. You can legally camp for free, with camper and RV on the whole 80 acres. A claim owner does not need permission nor a permit to camp and prospect. Prospect, explore, and camp on the whole 80 acres. This is not a sharing of a mining claim: Is your exclusive ownership.

TERMS:

To purchase the claim, the process would be, I would need your name(s) and mailing address where I would scan and email you a signed contract.

Cedar City's economy is based on tourism, agriculture, mining and Southern Utah State University. With a population of over 30,000 people, Cedar City has all of the amenities anyone needs. The area has experienced rapid growth over the last 30 years, and it does not appear to be declining. From shopping to dining, Cedar City has dozens of options of each. The city has full medical services and a highly rated school system. While the weather is vastly different, due to their proximity, Cedar City and St. George share cultural ties.  

St. George
A slightly longer drive than Cedar City, but a city with nearly three times the population. Located near the Utah, Arizona, and Nevada borders, St. George sits at the edge of the Mojave Desert. The city is located less than two hours from Las Vegas and is the most populated city in Utah located outside the Wasatch Front. The area is consistently among the fastest growing and most desirable places to live lists published in the last ten years.  

Climate
Cedar City's climate is the typical cool semi-arid climate of the Mountain West, though snowfall can be quite heavy. With around 250 days of sunshine, summer highs are in the 90's and winter lows fall to the teens. This makes it an ideal climate for both summer and winter recreation. In contrast, St George has an abundant amount of sunshine year-round. The city averages over 300 sunny days per year, with an average of only 8.80 inches of precipitation annually.

Interstate 80 traverses Elko County, making it a convenient destination. With a population of around 25,000, the city has all the amenities one could need including restaurants, hotels, and shopping. This area of Nevada also has many outdoor activities within a short drive. The mountains, lakes, and rivers around Elko offer numerous recreational opportunities. Among the wide-open spaces can be found spectacular mountain ranges and canyons suitable for picnicking, hiking or more serious outdoor adventures.  Elko County is the fourth largest county in the United States, consisting of 17,181 square miles, as big as five of the New England states plus the District of Columbia.

With two spectacular wilderness areas and thousands of square miles of open space, Elko County offers limitless outdoor recreation opportunities  including hiking, mountain biking, rock climbing, horseback riding, camping, golf, wildlife viewing, backpacking, boating, fishing and ATVing. The Ruby Mountains, which have been described as Nevadas Alps, provide the most breathtaking scenery. Hiking trails are suitable for all skill levels, from the family-friendly Nature Trail to the 40-mile Ruby Crest Trail. Trails for hikers and horseback riders lead over Liberty Pass into the Ruby Wilderness, with its clear alpine lakes and panoramic views.

Three-quarters of Elko County is public land, which gives wildlife such as mule deer, antelope, mountain goats and bighorn sheep plenty of room to roam. The hunting season offers tag-holders a shot at big game, as well as the unusual birds such as chukar and Hungarian partridge, Sagehen, Quail, Dove and the illusive Himalayan Snowcock.

Our claim here is about 6 miles north of the town of Je...Our claim here is about 6 miles north of the town of Jefferson, in Park County, Colorado.
This area known as South Park is an all season area for outdoor activities in a valley surrounded by the Rocky Mountains.
Is about 45 minutes east of the town of Fairplay.
Is about an hour southeast of the cool resort town of Breckenridge.
Park County is where the show Gold Rush filmed for a season.

This claim is unique as is hiking trail access only, with parking at the campground or a road turnout, adding to the privacy of the claim.
This trail is great for backpacking, camping, and hiking.
Claim is located on the West Jefferson Trail, the trailhead being at the campground,
This claim is then for those who want a secluded claim where you can hike in only 1/4 mile from the road and parking area.
You can camp in the forest near the creek or use the Jefferson Creek Campground at the beginning of the trail with parking.
Only 1/2 mile north is Jefferson Lake with a boat ramp and great fishing.

The 5.5 mile Jefferson Loop Trail offers a timber foot bridge which crosses Jefferson Creek, and several gentle switchbacks which allow access to the southeast side of a forested ridge which is an extension of the Continental Divide.

Being in a valley surrounded by mountains, annual winter snow runoff brings down gold and gems into Jefferson Creek.
The bends in the creek make for excellent gold catching areas.
Up the mountain ridges are good places for gems.
Beautifully forested area of pines and aspens.

The Jefferson Lake Recreation area is just up the road, with beautiful Jefferson Lake and a boat ramp for boating, and the lake is known for excellent fishing.
This claim lies within Colorados historically rich, mineral belt.

The largest nugget unearthed from this area and possibly all of Colorado, was discovered just north of our claim. It weighs an exceptional 9.3 pounds and is referred to as Toms Baby. This Nugget is the centerpiece of the Denver Museum of Nature and Science Mineral Collection, and can still be viewed and enjoyed today at the museum.

Rockhounding in Colorado 
Starting with the rich gold and silver deposits which were the starting point of so many Colorado towns, the Centennial State, with over 770 types of minerals to be found, is second only to California in the number of different gems and minerals statewide.
Colorado is also host to a dizzying array of rocks and minerals. Some of the higher profile include dinosaur fossils.
Colorado can certainly be considered a rockhound and gem hunters dream. 
The vast mountains of national forests gives one a newfound sense of exploration and discovery.

Gold prices reached an all time high of $2000 per ounce:

This claim is less than an hour from where the TV show Gold Rush was filmed on location at the Todd Hoffman mining claim near Fairplay.
Park County has miles of ATV and snowmobile trails to add to your mining claim experience.
Another good sign for our claims here are the other experienced prospectors who have claims in this area before us.

The discovery of gold in 1859 brought thousands of prospectors to this exact area. 
A new mining camp called Fair Play was established. Be a part of your own gold prospecting journey in having your own mining claim as those who came before you.
It is a little known fact that Park County contains the highest gold and silver mines in North America. It also contains some of the highest historic ranches and a wealth of historic railroad sites. Some working ranches in the region provide accommodations and access to private fishing. Visitors who take advantage of Park Countys attractions do so in a beautiful mountain area that has remained relatively unchanged for more than 100 years.

I am a retired teacher, and got into prospecting as a hobby with my family.
I am 72 and my wife 69, and we have gained the experience to select the best areas to locate claims.

We feel we are selling more than the gold and minerals on beautiful land.

Mining Claims as an investment: if you purchase a claim from us, at no charge, I would help you if you ever decided to sell in the future.
Mining Claims are a great investment, as claims go up in value over time, just as land does.

Gold and gems discovered in our own prospecting long with the beauty of the area, makes for awesome camping  and prospecting.
There are no more areas on Jefferson Creek to locate a claim.

Owning a mining claim is having access to a lifetime of great family fun and recreation, in a very beautiful, natural setting.

This is a 20 acre unpatented, gold mining placer claim, the Jefferson Trail #4, with the beautiful Jefferson Creek running thru the claim, in the Rocky Mountains, and the Pike National Forest. 
The claim is legally registered with the Bureau of Land Management out of Lakewood, CO and the Park County Recorder. 
You own the mineral rights, not sharing with others, on the 20 acres, and use your 20 acres recreationally for camping and prospecting in an awesome, beautiful area.

For the possibility of constructing any building you for others could live in, you need to file a Plan of Operation with the BLM for approval, showing you have developed a full-time operation performing diligent mining, though the BLM is reluctant to approve anything to live in,
You do not need a plan, permission nor a permit to camp and prospect.
You do not need to be a full time prospector to file a Plan for a shed type structure.

With an approved BLM Plan of Operation, a building can be built on the land: any building that benefits and improves the claim, though you cannot live on a mining claim. 
As stated by the BLM, this can be the ""construction of a building, road, fence, or enclosure necessary for mining.""
Current usage, is what the BLM calls, Casual Use: panning, shovel, rock hammer, metal detector, creek powered sluice box, where no permission nor permit is needed to camp and prospect.

On our visits to the claim, we gathered in and around the creek, approx. 1/8 of an ounce of gold, being worth about $220. As the BLM does not specify the amount of gold to be found to locate a claim other than gold needs to be discovered, we use this amount for a 20 acre claim as a projection of good gold potential. Someone with more time may find more. Gold prices are over $1700/ounce. Though we could never guarantee what you will find, we did locate this claim in an historically rich area for gold prospecting.
Gold prices in the last 3 years have gone up $400 per ounce.
We also found some nice samples of smoky quartz and fluorite on the claim ridges,

You are allowed to post No Trespassing for Prospecting signs in and around the claim.
A mining claim owner may limit or restrict public recreational use of/or public access across claims or portions of claims that are actively used for prospecting, mining, or processing operations where public recreational use of a claim would endanger or materially interfere with legitimate mining pursuits.

Camp on your claim or nearby national forest campgrounds.
A claim owner does not need permission nor a permit to camp and prospect.
You can prospect as little or as much as you like.
Now that we have located the claims, you never have to declare to the BLM any gold or gems you find.

With 14,000-foot peaks, a rolling and colorful river valley, mining history, twisting and ancient bristlecone pine and abundant wildlife, Colorado's Park County is one of the state's most beautiful designated heritage areas and is home to the towns of FairPlay, Alma, and Jefferson.

One of the favorite Centennial State drives sweeps drivers from atop Kenosha Pass and swoops them down into the South Park valley, where they find a delightful contrast of green ranchland, oxbowed creeks and soaring, snowcapped mountain summits.

The term South Park was first used in the 1840s by hunters and trappers who traversed the Rocky Mountains. Ten years later, word spread across America of three successful gold strikes in Colorado (Check out Colorado Ghost Towns for other Gold Rush-era relics). Fortune seekers flocked to the area and gold camps sprang up overnight. From 1860-1863, Park County boasted $1.5 million in gold extraction. By the 1880s the area was known for its mineral springs, hunting, fishing and wildflower meadows.

Perched high in the Rockies, Park County is a microcosm of Western and natural history. Averaging 9,000 feet in elevation, this compelling region is home to the nation's highest town, ranches, gold mines, mountain passes, and Ute encampments.

The creek on the claim is a unique advantage for gold prospecting.
Gold always occurs in gravels in the metallic state and when so found has various physical characteristics. Gold is dense and heavy, it has a characteristic metallic color, and it is soft and easily malleable (it is easily formed by hammering). These are the characteristics used by prospectors to identify gold in the field.
Placer gold occurs on the claim as small grains derived from gossan formed by weathering, and oxidation of the gold, copper and iron rich veins. Gold also occurs as grains flakes and small nuggets derived from the erosion of mineralized fault zones on, and upstream from the claim.

TERMS
To purchase our claim, the process would be, I would need your name(s) and mailing addresswhere I would scan and email you a signed contract, and which payment option you choose:

Total price of $3500, that can be paid in one full payment where your ownership is then transferred after receiving payment, 
or $3500, paying $1750 first month, and $1750 2nd month,
or $3500, paying $1500 first month, $1000 2nd month, and $1000 3rd month,

A $99 deed processing fee is paid with final payment.

Owner financing, No credit check. No interest charged.
No down payment.
You can use the claim as yours while making monthly payments.
Ownership transfer after final monthly payment.
A signed contract will precede payment.   

After receiving your final payment, your ownership of the 20 acre claim will be legally recorded with the local Bureau of Land Management and Park County. The quit claim deed is the correct document to be recorded for a mining claim, as stated by the BLM. This is not a sharing with others of your 20 acre claim.

We live in Ohio. Our connection to Colorado is our daughter lives in Denver, though she is not involved with our claims. We visited her in September, then went to prospect and locate mining claims, as we have been doing for a number of years.

And just a note of encouragement for you if purchase:
My wife and I have located, prospected on, and sold mining claims in California, Colorado, Arizona, and now also in Montana, Wyoming, and South Dakota, for now over 25 years.
You can trust we will process your notarized deeds correctly and quickly.
In that mining claims are processed thru the Bureau of Land Management, a Federal Govt. agency, not following thru per our legally signed contract, would be a federal crime. I certainly will do what I say, and would never put myself nor my wife in any legal jeopardy.
Also, we have sold properties on 4 sites online for over 25 years:
Landsalelistings, Landwatch, LandsofAmerica, and LandandFarm.
Our continued good status on these sites is due to our always following thru, as just one time we would not, we would not be allowed to sell on these sites ever again.

COMMENTS FROM SATISFIED CLAIM BUYERS:

""Living in Colorado, the purchase of our mining claim from you has been great for family fun and recreation. We have camped overnight a number of times, and panned for gold in the creek. We were even able to find gold flakes on several of our attempts. Thank you so much!""

""We purchased a 40 acre claim in California from Mr. Leu. Our claim is everything he told us it would be: Beautiful area, great for family camping outings, and, we have found gold while panning in the creek on our claim. We could not be happier with our purchase!""

""We purchased 2 mining claims from Michael Leu over the last 2 years, one in California, and one In Colorado. We have been to our claims on several occasions, and we could not be happier! They are exactly as described, and our camping on our claims and prospecting in the creek on each claim is the highlight of our vacations. You can trust Mr. Leu.

This 10-Acre parcel of recreational land can be found in the Silver River Reserve, in southern Houghton County, in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The Silver River Reserve is located south of Alston, an unincorporated community. Just to the east of Houghton county is Baraga County where schools, churches, shopping, and a hospital are found. This rural village was originally named Laird, and had its own post office in 1887. When J.V. Alston became postmaster in April 1902, the community and post office were renamed for him. In the late 1940's, to early 1950's, a group of avid hunters formed the Silver River Reserve to promote access to outdoor opportunities for their members. Since that time sports men and women have enjoyed this remote, wooded area, with the Silver River running through it, for hiking, hunting, and all-season recreational opportunities. The area is renowned for hunting. This parcel is a quarter mile away from thousands of acres of Ottawa National Forest Land and just 1.5 miles to the east is the Sturgeon River Gorge Wilderness. There is ""walk-in"" access to hunting, trapping, and fishing on these vast land holdings. Black bear, Bobcat, Coyote, Ruffed grouse, Whitetail deer, Rabbits and other woodland animals are available. Farce Creek, Humbug Creek, Gurgle Creek, Boulder Creek, Tradition Creek, and the Silver River, all tributaries of the Sturgeon River, flow through the Reserve. The Sturgeon is a cool water fishery, rated a Type 1 Fishing Stream. Atlantic salmon, Brook trout, Brown trout, Coho, Chinook and Pink salmon, Lake trout, Rainbow trout, and Splake are fish species of note. A good sized river, it flows about 100 miles from its source at Wagner Lake to its mouth at Portage Lake. There's also some good lake fishing available at nearby Prickett Lake. Besides fishing almost at your door step, you can jump on your snowmobile or ATV and access the Winona-Alston Multi-Use State Trail not far away!
